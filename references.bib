	abstract = {This paper examines the factors that affect the adoption and diffusion of the Semantic Web by using a grounded theory approach. Grounded theory, a qualitative research methodology, is appropriate to achieve this, because the Semantic Web is currently at an early introduction stage. Data was gathered through in-depth interviews with fifteen informants from user organizations adopted the Semantic Web and suppliers that supported the implementation of the projects. The interview transcripts were analyzed by using the open coding scheme of grounded theory. Five factors affecting the adoption and infusion of the Semantic Web were identified. The first factor is demand pull including requirements for solving search and integration problems of existing systems and for creating new services. Second, such things as environmental conduciveness, potential business value, government sponsorship programs, active roles of suppliers, etc. affect the adoption of the Semantic Web from the perspective of technology push. Third, organizational competence including communication and absorptive capacity plays an important role in its adoption. Fourth, user's over-expectation has a negative impact on its adoption. Finally, various factors affect the infusion of the Semantic Web, such as additional investment budget for extending systems based on the Semantic Web, sharing ontologies, and demonstrable effects.},

	abstract = {This paper aims to present the results of an investigation of the prevailing challenges in construction information management. The study implemented a quantitative survey methodology, using a questionnaire to gather data from architects, civil engineers, quantity surveyors, mechanical and electrical engineers, construction managers, and project managers. Data analysis was conducted using the SPSS software package: applicable measures of dispersal were computed and inferential statistical tests performed. The study revealed that information management is a significant aspect of construction procedures and that a well-structured information system must be in place to achieve success in the construction domain. Additionally, the researchers discovered that construction information management could be affected by both internal and external factors within an organization. Further findings revealed that the major challenges in construction information management are long-term reliance on legacy systems, a lack of technological equipment, leadership development, poor financial investment in infrastructure for data management, and the implementation of appropriate policies by management. The primary contribution of this study lies in its appraisal of the difficulties facing construction information management and its identification of the relevant challenges, which can help in the proposal of solutions to improve methods of managing construction information, in turn producing improved performance and more efficient delivery of services on the part of professionals within the construction industry.},

It identiﬁes various inﬂuencing aspects related to the use of recycled aggregates, such as replacement level, size and origin, as well as the inﬂuence of curing conditions, use of chemical admixtures and additions, on carbonation over a long period of time. A statistical analysis on the effect of introducing increasing amounts of recycled aggregates on the carbonation depth and coefﬁcient of accelerated carbonation is presented. This paper also presents the use of existing methodologies to estimate the required accelerated carbonation resistance of a reinforced recycled aggregate concrete exposed to natural carbonation conditions with the use of accelerated carbonation tests. Results show clear increasing carbonation depths with increasing replacement levels when recycled aggregate concrete mixes are made with a similar mix design to that of the control natural aggregate concrete. The relationship between the compressive strength and coefﬁcients of accelerated carbonation is similar between the control concrete and the recycled aggregate concrete mixes.},

	abstract = {The use of recycled concrete aggregates (RCA) as a replacement in new concrete has gained popularity worldwide as a method of reducing natural aggregate consumption. Many engineers, owners, and agencies are reticent to use RCA due to a lack of understanding on how the material will impact overall concrete properties. This lack of acceptance has been hindered by the difficulty of doing large-scale studies because of the time and cost of casting different concrete mixtures. Many individual studies have been completed but little work has been done to analyze that work to make broad conclusions on RCA concrete mechanical properties. This paper presents the development and analysis of a database of mechanical properties of concrete containing coarse RCA generated from 115 peer-reviewed journal articles. A sensitivity study of RCA systems was conducted through a full-factorial analysis to explore how the mixture design proportions influence the RCA concrete hardened properties. On average, the compressive strengths of concrete systems with 20\% or less RCA replacement were 2\% lower than that of the natural aggregate systems. Increased levels of RCA replacements decreased the average concrete compressive strengths with the highest average strength loss, in which a 10\% reduction compared to natural aggregate systems is observed at 100\% RCA replacement level. Results indicate that, in general, adequate concrete strengths for a variety of applications can be achieved at all replacement ratios of coarse RCA. Impacts of mixture design properties on particular mechanical properties are presented along with bivariate contour plots that can be used by concrete mixture designers to better estimate RCA concrete properties. This work supports an increased adoption of RCA by providing broad conclusions supported by statistical analysis that show typical performance of RCA concrete across a variety of design inputs.},

The basic tests such as, dry density, 28 days wet compressive strength, water absorption and rate of moisture absorption are performed on CSMB units of size 190×90×90mm. The correction factors that are available in the literature, with respect to fired clay bricks and compressed earth blocks, so as to account for the confinement of specimens by platen restraints at the ends are used to assess the uniaxial strength of CSMB units. The corrected average values of wet compressive strength of CSMB units at 28 days are found to meet the minimum requirement of 3.5MPa. The percentage of water absorption is found to be higher, but, still within permissible limit of 18\% by weight. The average dry density is also found to meet the minimum requirement of 1750kg/m3. The rate of moisture absorption with time is found to follow an exponential trend.},

	abstract = {The objective of this study was the development of a NIRS (Near InfraRed Spectroscopy) and PLSR (Partial Least Square Regression) model for quantitatively determining extractives, in four clones of the Italian cypress Cupressus sempervirens. Extractives were correlated to the fungal resistance of wood samples evaluated with a non-standard procedure based on the mass loss of mini-blocks. PLSR regression models based on NIRS gave good predictions of extractives content with RPD (Residual Prediction Deviation) equal or above 2.7, suggesting that NIRS-PLSR procedure could be used for the characterization of cypress wood. Total extractives were significantly different among heartwood and sapwood but not among clones. Both inner and outer heartwood of the four C. sempervirens clones were resistant to three brown rot fungi. Minimal differences were found among clones in the mass loss of the heartwood samples, while significant inter-clonal differences emerged in the mass loss of sapwood samples. Intra-clonal variation was detected for sapwood samples and only in one of the four tested clones. The correlation between durability and extractives content was significant only if sapwood was added to heartwood in the dataset. Nevertheless, the high durability observed in the examined clones encourages selection of these cypress genotypes for wood production.},

Natural durability tests were performed using the test fungi Gloeophyllum trabeum and Coniophora puteana. FT-NIR spectra were recorded and average spectra were calculated for calibration modelling. The models were strong [R 2 (CV)=70.7–95.19, RMSEP=0.063–0.026] and showed better suitability with spectra acquired from radial surfaces compared to those from axial surfaces. The prediction model was valid across larch species (European and Siberian), so that exact knowledge of the growth and site conditions was not required.},

Therefore, it has been recognized that not all NDT methods or all combinations of NDT methods can be used for all structures. Further, the type and degree of a structural defect is a function of the environment the structure is subjected to. Because of the great amount of research which has been recently conducted in this field, general parameters which could be identified by various NDT techniques for various building materials and the advantages and disadvantages of each technique need to be identified. The authors have been able to achieve this by means of a literature survey.

	abstract = {The Impact-Echo (IE) test is an effective method for determining the presence, depth, and area of cracks in concrete as well as the dimensions of the sound concrete without defects. In addition, shallow delamination can be measured by confirming a flexural mode in the low-frequency region. Owing to the advancement of non-contact sensors and automated measurement equipment, the IE test can be measured at multiple points in a short period. To analyze and distinguish a large volume of data, applying supervised learning (SL) associated with various contemporary algorithms is necessary. However, SL has limitations due to the difficulty in accurate labeling for increased volumes of test data, and reflection of new specimen characteristics, and it is necessary to apply semi-supervised learning (SSL) to overcome them. This study analyzes the accuracy and evaluates the applicability of a model trained with SSL rather than SL using the data from the air-coupled IE test based on dynamic preconditions. For the detection of delamination defects, the dynamic behavior-based flexural mode was identified, and 21 features were extracted in the time and frequency domains. Three principal components (PCs) such as the real moment, real RMS, and imaginary moment were derived through principal component analysis (PCA). PCs were identical in slab, pavement, and deck. In the case of SSL considering a dynamic behavior, the accuracy increased by 7–8\% compared with SL, and it could categorize good, fair, and poor status to a higher level for actual structures. The applicability of SSL to the IE test was confirmed, and because the crack progress varies under field conditions, other parameters must be considered in the future to reflect this.},

The existing local connection damage identification methods require expensive instrumentation and the sensors at a specific location. That is why, artificial intelligence (AI) has become very popular and has come up with better alternatives, efficiency which can overcome the shortcomings of traditional vibration-based connection damage identification techniques. As per the current literature, most of the AI-based techniques that use experimentally generated damage data suffer the paucity of appropriate and quality dataset corresponding to different damage conditions. Hence the authors have proposed a model-based scheme for evaluating the health condition of steel structural connection in such cases, which uses a combination of Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and Continuous Wavelet Transform (CWT) of the response signal. The method requires only global vibration signals from impulse excitation on the structure and subsequently the updated finite element (FE) model of steel structure considering connection flexibility can be utilized for multiple functionalities. For experimental validation of the proposed methodology, a two-story structural steel frame has been considered. The performance of the proposed methodology is further verified and validated through the identification of beam-column connection damage additionally introduced in the test frame.},

	abstract = {Remaining fatigue life estimations are crucial for guaranteeing the operation reliability and structural integrity of engineering components. In this respect, physical process-based damage theories and data-driven machine learning (ML) techniques are two useful tools for damage accumulation analyses. However, conventional damage theories are generally limited to specific materials and loading conditions due to over-restrictive assumptions and laborious calibration procedures; on the other hand, ML techniques are easy to be afflicted by the inadequacy of training data in practice. To overcome these limitations, a damage theory-informed machine learning (DT-iML) model is proposed in this work, which enables the integrated utilization of domain knowledge and raw data information. In the model, a damage theory, i.e., the Ye-Wang theory, is introduced as the baseline for optimizing the data-driven processes of model training and prediction. Moreover, the subtractive clustering is further integrated to stabilize the model performance through constructing a global-representative training dataset. Extensive experimental results of nine metallic materials under two-step loading are collected from the literature for model evaluation and comparison. The results demonstrated that the DT-iML model allows for lower data requirement and higher performance stability than purely data-driven ML model, and meanwhile show better estimation accuracy and robustness than conventional damage theory.},

To achieve this aim, this article proposes a novel methodology using the concept of supervised learning. The main objective of the proposed methodology is to train various supervised learning classifiers using a training dataset that consists of features regarding both the undamaged and damaged states of the structure before the maintenance program in the first level. Once the classifiers have been trained, one attempts to predict the class labels of test samples associated with the current state of the structure after the maintenance program during the second level. According to the predefined class labels of the training and test samples in the first stage, it is feasible to recognize the current state of the maintained structure in the second level and detect potential damage. The major contribution of this article is to introduce the concept of supervised learning for damage detection in an innovative manner. A numerical concrete beam and an experimental laboratory frame are used to demonstrate the effectiveness and applicability of the proposed methodology. Results show that this methodology is a practical and reliable tool for structural condition assessment and damage detection of maintained structures.},

	abstract = {A dual attention deep learning network is developed to classify three types of steel defects, locate their positions, and depict their shapes on the steel surface in an automatic and accurate manner. The novel pixel-level detection algorithm called DAN-DeepLabv3+ integrates a dual attention module into the DeepLabv3+ framework in pursue of more precise segmentation results. For one thing, the dual parallel attention module helps to explicitly model rich contextual dependencies over local feature representations in the spatial and channel dimensions. For another, the popular DeepLabv3+ in an encoder-decoder architecture is useful in capturing multi-scale contextual information and sharp object boundaries. The DAN-DeepLabv3+ is applied to an available dataset containing 6666 images, where three types of steel defects are taken by high-frequency cameras and have been annotated manually. Experimental results show that, compared with other deep learning models, DAN-DeepLabv3+ based on the Xception backbone exhibits the best segmentation performance under the mean intersection over union (IoU) of 89.95\% and the frequency-weighted IoU of 97.34\%. Besides, the F1-score for the three kinds of defects can reach 86.90\%, 99.20\%, and 92.81\%. From the comparative study, it has been found that the adoption of the dual attention module and DeepLabv3+ contributes to boosting the segmentation performance. The significance of the proposed hybrid model lies in the enhancement in accurately detecting single or multiple steel defects, which has proven to outperform other classical methods.},

In doing so, a brief background, models, functions, and classification of DM techniques are presented. To this end, wide range of researches are collected in order to demonstrate the development of DM techniques, detect the most popular DM techniques, and compare the applicability of existing DM techniques in SHM.

	abstract = {Bio-based building materials offer a wide range of outlooks, from traditional rustic to modern design products. Recent development in the science of materials significantly improves their functional performance. However, when considering the use of bio-materials in outdoor environments, materials will deteriorate due to processes like weathering, oxidation, biodegradation, wear, and decay. Consequentially, biomaterials may lose visual appeal, leading to a perceived need for replacement even if the material is far from reaching functional failure. Visual assessment is the most direct method for evaluation of the aesthetic appearance of materials. However, it possesses a high degree of subjectivity when performed by an untrained person. On the contrary, measurement of surface properties with dedicated sensors provides objective values that might be related to the current state of the material in use. Recent developments in field of optics and electronics opens a new possibility to perform measurements in-situ. Colour-, gloss-, or spectro-photo-meters allow non-destructive measurements without particular sample preparation. Since all of the above techniques provide complementary information, the multi-sensor approach is more frequently suggested for applied research. The material state can be assessed regularly during service life. In this case, such measurement turns into monitoring. The paper illustrates examples of assessment and monitoring of biomaterials’ degradation due to weathering. Direct implementation of various sensors is demonstrated. A proposal for the approach of combining data provided by various sensing techniques with data mining is also presented.},

Crack detection plays an important role in ensuring the safety and durability of structures. Conventionally, a maintenance engineer performs crack detection manually, which is laborious and time-consuming. Therefore, a systematic crack detection method is required. Among the existing crack detection methods, convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are more effective; however, CNNs often fail in the case of brick walls. There are several types of bricks, and some may appear to have cracks owing to their structure. Additionally, the joining points of bricks may appear as cracks; therefore, CNN fails. It is theorized that CNN performance can be improved if sub-datasets are generated based on the image attributes, and a proper sub-dataset is selected by matching the test image with the sub-datasets. In this study, sub-dataset generation and matching methods are proposed to improve the performance of crack detection in brick walls using CNN. CNN training is conducted with each sub-dataset generated by the proposed sub-dataset generation method, while crack detection is performed using a proper trained CNN that is selected using the proposed matching method. For numerical experiments, training datasets are first prepared by manual image cropping and rotation, after which the performance of crack detection is evaluated by cross-validation. Numerical experiments show that the proposed method improves crack detection in brick walls. This study will help to ensure the safety of structures as well as the safety of human life.},

	abstract = {With recent advances in non-contact sensing technology such as cameras, unmanned aerial and ground vehicles, the structural health monitoring (SHM) community has witnessed a prominent growth in deep learning-based condition assessment techniques of structural systems. These deep learning methods rely primarily on convolutional neural networks (CNNs). The CNN networks are trained using a large number of datasets for various types of damage and anomaly detection and post-disaster reconnaissance. The trained networks are then utilized to analyze newer data to detect the type and severity of the damage, enhancing the capabilities of non-contact sensors in developing autonomous SHM systems. In recent years, a broad range of CNN architectures has been developed by researchers to accommodate the extent of lighting and weather conditions, the quality of images, the amount of background and foreground noise, and multiclass damage in the structures. This paper presents a detailed literature review of existing CNN-based techniques in the context of infrastructure monitoring and maintenance. The review is categorized into multiple classes depending on the specific application and development of CNNs applied to data obtained from a wide range of structures. The challenges and limitations of the existing literature are discussed in detail at the end, followed by a brief conclusion on potential future research directions of CNN in structural condition assessment.},

	abstract = {An accurate concrete carbonation predictive model is needed to ensure effective structural health monitoring of concrete, as a result of nonlinear behaviour of concrete carbonation and uncertainties of environmental factors affecting the progress of carbonation. In reality, the performance of a developed predictive model lies on its ability to accurately generalise (simulate) the input distribution within a given new dataset. The previous machine learning models in the studies for concrete carbonation depth rely on the performance of the validation subset used for updating network weights during training and offer no generalisation performance of the model. This study developed a recurrent neural networks (RNN) model to predict the carbonation of fly ash blended concrete. Eighteen input datasets that focused on the chemical parameters of cement and fly ash were used in addition to established environmental factors. A total of 534 sets of experimental data were extracted from 13 published works of the literature. A leave-one-out cross-validation (training and generalisation subsets) was used. The developed RNN model was compared with the artificial neural networks (ANNs), support vector machine (SVM), radial basis function neural networks (RBFNNs), multi-linear regression (MLR) and bagged and boosted decision trees models that have been previously used to model carbonation depth in concrete. The results shows that the proposed RNN has a high prediction and generalisation capability in the evaluation of carbonation depth, and the highest correlation coefficient of 0.94 than the comparing models. Further, the generalisation subsets show that the results of natural exposed conditions are more reliable than the accelerated test cases.},

However, due to external factors or internal compositions, concrete can be damaged and hence affects the quality of the constructions. The type of damage that appeared on concrete is often the first a clue as to how it occurred. Therefore proper diagnosing of the problem can help engineers determine how quickly and how best to fix it. The application of information technology, especially artificial intelligence, to automatically classify the damage types can help tremendously in this aspect. There have been some studies in using computer vision to examine the surfaces of concrete for damages.

	abstract = {When simulating the hygrothermal behaviour of a building component, there are many inherently uncertain parameters. A probabilistic evaluation takes these uncertainties into account, allowing a more dependable assessment of the hygrothermal behaviour. However, this often necessitates many Monte Carlo simulations, which easily become computationally inhibitive. To overcome this time-expense problem, the hygrothermal model can be replaced by a metamodel, a much simpler mathematical model which aims at mimicking the original model with a strongly reduced calculation time. In this paper, a metamodel is developed to directly predict hygrothermal time series (e.g. temperature, relative humidity, moisture content), rather than single-valued derived performance indicators (e.g. maximum mould index), as these hygrothermal time series yield more information, and also allow the user to post-process the output as desired. So far, no metamodelling strategies able to tackle time series are available in the field of building physics. Because the hygrothermal response of a building component is highly non-linear and transient, this paper focuses on neural networks for time series, as they have proven successful in many other fields. The performance and training time of three popular types of networks (multilayer perceptron, recurrent neural network, convolutional neural network) is evaluated based on an application example of a massive masonry wall. The results indicate that only the recurrent and convolutional networks are able to capture the complex patterns of the hygrothermal response. Additionally, the convolutional network performed significantly better and was 10 times faster to train for the current application example, compared to the recurrent network.},

	abstract = {This paper reports the application of deep learning for implementing the anomaly detection of defects on concrete structures, so as to facilitate the visual inspection of civil infrastructure. A convolutional autoencoder was trained as a reconstruction-based model, with the defect-free images, to rapidly and reliably detect defects from the large volume of image datasets. This training process was in the unsupervised mode, with no label needed, thereby requiring no prior knowledge and saving an enormous amount of time for label preparation. The built anomaly detector favors minimizing the reconstruction errors of defect-free images, which renders high reconstruction errors of defects, in turn, detecting the location of defects. The assessment shows that the proposed anomaly detection technique is robust and adaptable to defects on wide ranges of scales. Comparison was also made with the segmentation results produced by other automatic classical methods, revealing that the results made by the anomaly map outperform other segmentation methods, in terms of precision, recall, F1 measure and F2 measure, without severe under- and over-segmentation. Further, instead of merely being a binary map, each pixel of the anomaly map is represented by the anomaly score, which acts as a risk indicator for alerting inspectors, wherever defects on concrete structures are detected.},

	abstract = {Abstract: The anomalies related with durability of building masonry walls and their confining concrete elements are often related to the occurrence of cracking/detachment and with the presence of moisture. In many situations, it involves the cracking of masonry walls and the deterioration of concrete which, in cases of greater severity, results in the detachment of the walls render and in the local delamination of the concrete elements (columns, walls and beams), with the uncovering of the steel reinforcement and their consequent corrosion. Automated anomalies detection, in inspection of these anomalies, based on image processing techniques, can be done using the non-destructive testing (NDT). The paper intends to identify the most common anomalies related with durability affecting the functionality and aesthetics and, in some situations, the safety of heritage buildings with reinforced concrete structure, seeking to typify the main anomalies related to the durability of materials and construction elements. A methodology of recognition of the most relevant patterns of these anomalies is briefly presented, in particular through image processing and features extraction of anomaly patterns in facade walls and on confinement elements of reinforced concrete, with the purpose of subsequent use within the framework of support to the inspection actions and consequent maintenance of this type of heritage buildings.},

These methods are based on auto-regression model and time series estimation model, and still work when the structure is excited using immeasurable inputs. The dynamic response of a six-story steel frame analysed using the finite element method is used to validate these methods. Experimental results reveal that the PLLS and FCNN methods based on auto-regression model performs less well than the LSTMNN method based on time series estimation model, and it has a large the prediction peak mean square error. In addition, PLLS method is sensitive to noise, but FCNN and LSTMNN method based on deep learning are highly robust and anti-noise performance.

However, the low granularity of inspections puts many assets at the same priority level, thus leaving asset managers with difficult decisions as to which assets are more deserving of the limited funds available. This study aims to improve fund-allocation decisions by applying data mining techniques to provide a more granular classification of asset criticality. The study relies on textual information from inspection reports of 400 schools across Toronto and focuses on roofings due to their higher need for repairs. First, rule-based text mining is used to identify the damage type and extent from the damage descriptions in the inspection reports. Then, unsupervised clustering is used to classify the suggested renewal events into four criticality levels based on the extracted data and other relevant parameters such as age. The proposed framework could identify that only 8.8\% of deteriorated roofs are highly critical and can be funded with the available limited budget. The proposed approach is adaptable to other asset types and components and can substantially improve the fund allocation practice for large owner organizations such as municipalities and school boards.},

	abstract = {Anomaly detection by Mahalanobis-squared distance (MSD) is a popular unsupervised learning approach to structural health monitoring (SHM). Despite the popularity and high applicability of the MSD-based anomaly detection method, some major challenging issues and limitations such as environmental variability, determination of an inappropriate threshold limit, estimation of an inaccurate covariance matrix, and non-Gaussianity of training data may lead to false alarms and erroneous results of damage detection. The main objective of this article is to propose a novel anomaly detection method based on adaptive Mahalanobis-squared distance and one-class kNN rule called AMSD-kNN for SHM under varying environmental conditions. The central idea behind the proposed method is to find sufficient nearest neighbors of training and testing datasets in a two-stage procedure for removing the environmental variability conditions and estimate local covariance matrices. An effective approach based on a multivariate normality hypothesis test is proposed to find sufficient nearest neighbors that guarantee the estimate of well-conditioned local covariance matrices. The great novelty of the proposed AMSD-kNN method is to create a novel unsupervised learning strategy for SHM by a new multivariate distance measure and one-class kNN rule. Generalized extreme value distribution modeling by the block maxima (BM) method is presented to determine an accurate threshold limit. Due to the importance of choosing adequate blocks in the BM method, a goodness-of-fit measure via the Kolmogorov-Smirnov hypothesis test is applied to select an optimal block number. The performance and effectiveness of the proposed methods are verified by two well-known benchmark structures. Several comparative studies are also conducted to demonstrate the superiority of the proposed methods over some state-of-the-art techniques. Results show that the proposed AMSD-kNN and BM methods highly succeed in detecting damage under environmental variability conditions.},

Concrete is made from numerous ingredients that have huge variability either at the design stage or at the testing stage. The main goal of this paper is to quantify the anomalies and outliers during the design phase of concrete mixtures. Concrete mixtures have various percentages of ingredients such as cement, slag, fly ash, water, superplasticizer, fine and coarse aggregates. Machine learning and data mining is considered a very thriving topic in many research fields and its implementation in the construction industry still limited. Concrete community is in need for such a tool to produce an efficient way to efficiently design concrete mixtures. Outliers could occur during the evaluation of samples’ measurements that might include human or system errors. The Local Outlier Factor (LOF) algorithm is the most common method used to determine outliers, however, the LOF has some challenges. In this paper, an anomaly-based outlier detection algorithm called Isolation Forest based on a Sliding window for the Local Outlier Factor (IFS-LOF) algorithm, is proposed to solve the limitations of the LOF in evaluating 1030 concrete mixtures. The proposed algorithm works without any previous knowledge of data distribution and executes the process within limited memory and with minimal computational effort. The evaluation of results proved that the IFS-LOF algorithm is more efficient in detecting the sequence of outliers and provided more efficient accuracy that other state of the art LOF algorithms.},

	abstract = {The objective of enterprise building infrastructure management is to provide optimal allocation of maintenance, rehabilitation and replacement (MR\&R) resources and to preserve the condition of building components over a planning horizon. While most approaches have studied it as a finite resource allocation problem, the presence of an underlying building network configuration has been largely ignored. The development of a network model of building components introduces several challenges, as well as opportunities, for MR\&R decision-making and optimized building preservation, which cannot adequately be handled by the existing decision-making frameworks. One such challenge to enterprise building portfolio management is the lack of understanding for the correlation of one component’s condition state to another. Building component network-level optimization is not available as in other infrastructure domains, which makes calculating the benefit of component work activities on other building components very difficult to determine. This research focuses on using structured query language (SQL) based association rule mining to find frequent patterns of observed condition deterioration among different component types. A new metric, negative effective deterioration, is introduced which is based on actual deterioration observed from inspection data, relative to expected condition states. Frequent patterns of antecedent and consequent component pairs having negative effective deterioration states are discovered, and support and confidence factors indicate the strength of these correlations. The building component network model can improve enterprise work planning by considering the effects of negative effective deterioration on other correlated components. This new concept of network-level work optimization is used to identify antecedent component investment opportunities which have a large consequent component payoff by lowering the risk of future preventable deterioration. This process can decrease the long term deferred deficiency backlog by focusing limited MR\&R resources not just on the components in the worst condition, but on those that have the most adverse effect on the condition of associated components. The proposed method can discover a large number of component correlations with negative effective deterioration, which are usually neglected by facility managers, and be able to manage the facility components in the way that predicts unnecessary added deterioration and enable rapid correlation analysis. Furthermore, the correlation of building components is used to present a new approach in determining which components in a building are most critical to require a re-inspection.},

Well-functioning ‘performance models’ are absolutely essential to predict the service life and functionality of buildings, building assets, and building products over time. Different types of performance models have been established for various building materials, but cannot necessarily transferred to wood-based materials, primarily due to their organic character. For performance modelling of wood products biological agents need to be considered, such as wood disfiguring and degrading organisms. Different approaches to adequately reflect the influence of biotic and abiotic factors on the performance of wood have been reviewed and evaluated with respect to their usability in the building trade. We found that efforts in developing performance models for both fungal decay and mould growth have been intensified in recent years. A high heterogeneity among the numerous attempts became visible, different strategies have been followed, and were roughly distinguished according to the respective objectives, governing variables (e.g. mass loss, strength loss, remaining strength, decay ratings, service life, aesthetic appearance, etc.), data sources and the resulting level of accuracy. A framework of how exposure, dimension, design details, and the material-intrinsic ability to take up and release water can be linked to model the moisture risk in wood products is in principal available. Methods and models have the potential to get implemented not only in design guidelines, but also in European and international standards. In particular, various dosimeter models could serve as reliable tools to quantify the effects of different construction details.},

	abstract = {Statistical and machine learning analysis of structural health monitoring data is a popular approach for efficient structural level defect detection. However, the application of these techniques to stress-wave methods such as impact-echo and impulse-response data for local level detection has been limited. In this research, statistical pattern recognition in conjunction with the impulse-response test is shown to provide an efficient means for the detection of defects in concrete plates. For this purpose, the Frequency Response Function (FRF) derived from the impulse-response test following ASTM C1740 protocols at specific points on the test plate to define the feature space matrix. Analytical results demonstrate that the variability of the FRF increases in the presence of defects, which forms the physical basis for the proposed pattern recognition algorithm. First, Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is performed on the covariance of the feature space matrix to identify the dominant features of the FRFs and to determine the number of statistically significant factors or principal components. Factor scores are next used to identify locations on the plate that are associated most closely to each pattern. The generalized Extreme Value Studentized (ESD) test and box and whisker plots are applied to the factor score vector of all the test points to objectively identify test points with defects and rank these based on their severity. Two experimental specimens are used to demonstrate the applicability of the proposed detection algorithm. The first specimen, a partially reinforced clamped concrete plate, is used to demonstrate the relationship between the shapes and variability of the FRFs and the severity of defects (delaminations), the efficacy of the factor score as damage sensitive feature, and identification and the ranking of the severity of defects by using outlier statistical tests. The second specimen is used to demonstrate the efficiency of the procedure for detecting both void and honeycomb defects in a larger reinforced concrete plate on elastic supports. The proposed procedure is shown to provide similar levels of detectability as the highly refined yet time consuming ultrasonic shear-wave tomography test. While the impulse-response test has been in use for the condition assessment of concrete elements other than drilled shaft piles since 1980′s, defect detection has been based primarily on empirical observations and correlations with limited features of the frequency response function. The use of pattern recognition techniques to the full range of the frequency response function is proposed and shown to greatly improve the detection and characterization of defects.},

It is essential to accurately evaluate and predict the evolution of its frost resistance in a complex environment to promote its engineering application. The traditional experimental modeling method is difficult to overcome the complex nonlinearity and environmental sensitivity among concrete components. Therefore, this study employed three classical single ML models, including RG, ANN, and SVR, and three new ensemble learning models (RF, XGBoost, and Stacking) to predict the two indexes of frost resistance of rubberized concrete, i.e., RDEM and MLR. Before modeling, the LOF detection algorithm was used to process the initial dataset to reduce the training bias. In addition, the performance statistics of the above six ML models show that the XGBoost ensemble learning algorithm based on Boosting has the best prediction performance for the frost resistance of rubberized concrete, with more than 95 \% of the predictions distributed within the ± 20 \% confidence interval (R2 = 0.96, MAE = 0.15, RMSE = 0.27). According to the SHAP and the partial dependence analysis, adding an appropriate amount of rubber can improve the frost resistance of concrete. The recommended RC and RS ranges are 15 to 25 kg/m3 and 0.1 to 0.5 mm, respectively. These findings revealed that ML algorithms are an efficient and robust model for predicting rubberized concrete’s frost resistance.},

The life expectancy is estimated considering the effects of fungal attacks on the timber structural elements. The prediction of life expectancy of timber components is set up through (i) the analysis of the state of the art, (ii) the definition of risk classes and decision trees, (iii) the prediction of the decay, (iv) the definition of an inspection procedure, and (v) the development of an adaptive monitoring plan. The the state-of-the-art analysis of the construction details that most affect durability allows for defining the risk classes and decision trees that address all the possible scenarios where water can penetrate the construction detail. The decision trees associate one of the risk classes to the detail under analysis providing a straightforward indication about the exposure of the timber structural elements to decay due to fungal attack. The allocation to a risk class allows the evaluation of the main parameters of a decay prediction model based on functions for estimating the decay rate that are available in the literature. The decay predicted and the inspection results provide the input data to the adaptive motoring plan, defining an efficient program of inspections. Case studies were selected to validate the results of the decay prediction on the outcomes of onsite inspections and to provide sample data for setting the monitoring plan.},

	abstract = {Background: Defect detection and segmentation on product surfaces in industry has become one of the most important steps in quality control. There are many sophisticated hardware and software tools used in the industry for this purpose. The need for the real-time classification and detection of defects in industrial quality control has become a crucial requirement. Most algorithms and deep neural network architectures require expensive hardware to perform inference in real-time. This necessitates the design of architectures that are light-weight and suitable for deployment in industrial environments. Methods: In this study, we introduce a novel method for detecting wood planks on a fast-moving conveyor and using a convolutional neural network (CNN) to segment surface defects in real-time. A backbone network is trained with a large-scale image dataset. A dataset of 5000 images is created with proper annotation of wood planks and defects. In addition, a data augmentation technique is employed to enhance the accuracy of the model. Furthermore, we examine both statistical and deep learning-based approaches to identify and separate defects using the latest methods. Results: Our plank detection method achieved an impressive mean average precision of 97\% and 96\% of global pixel accuracy for defect segmentation. This remarkable performance is made possible by the real-time processing capabilities of our system, which can run at 30 frames per second (FPS) without sacrificing accuracy. Conclusions: The results of our study demonstrate the potential of our method not only in industrial wood processing applications but also in other industries where materials undergo similar processes of defect detection and segmentation. By utilizing our method, these industries can expect to see improved efficiency, accuracy, and overall productivity.},

A literature review on decay-influencing factors and on previous approaches to implement methods and tools for service life estimations was the basis for a concept for service life prediction of wooden components. The effect of various indirect decay factors was found to be reducible to a few direct decay factors, with material resistance, as well as wood moisture content, wood temperature and their dynamics among the key factors for fungal decay. Approaches that consider only indirect factors, e.g. climate indices, suffer from poor correlation with service life or decay rates. Therefore, the overall consideration of all possible influences, reduced on the key direct decay factors in first instance, is recommended. To fill a theoretical model with a reliable database, various data sources need to be considered, in decreasing order of priority: in-service performance, field test data, laboratory test data, survey analysis and expert opinion.},

Such degradation endangers the structural safety and increases the costs of maintenance and repair. Thus, for safety and economic reasons, it is important to correctly assess the condition of RC structures. The causes and mechanisms of the most common processes of deterioration are summarized, the pathologies and influential factors are identified and details given on how information about damaged structures can be collected. The useful information required for assessment is divided into three series of data: those related to the actual material condition, those related to the evolution of damage, and environmental factors. The weight of the latter is further discussed, since the influence of environmental factors on deterioration mechanisms, and also on the non destructive measurements is complex. Finally, some challenges for a better use of nondestructive techniques (NDT) are identified.},

Then, four samples of each tree were removed, totaling 40 samples, which were later subjected to non-destructive testing of apparent density, ultrasonic wave propagation velocity, dynamic modulus of elasticity obtained by ultrasound, and Janka hardness. These properties were used as estimators of resistance and compressive strength parallel to fibers, and hardness. Multilayer Perceptron networks were also employed, training 100 of them for each of the evaluated parameters.

In temperate climate zones, the most critical biological hazard is wood-destroying fungi, and the European standard EN 350 in combination with EN 113-2 provide guidance on sampling, testing, and classifying wood durability against brown and white rot fungi. However, in their latest revised versions, both standards recommend the use of probability density functions for fitting mass loss data (ML). Subsequently, the durability of wood and its variability should be further characterised. The aim of this study was to statistically analyse the ML data from laboratory agar plate tests with different European-grown wood species and to examine the effect of different statistical treatments on the standardised classification scheme of wood durability. It was concluded that more precise guidance is needed on the sampling procedure since significant differences in durability exist between stem zones. The assignment of dispersion indicators requires a revision to ensure clear, unmistakable, and reproducible durability classification of wood. Deficits in the description of the proposed statistical treatments in both standards became evident. It can be questioned whether the application of probability density functions provides additional information about the variability of wood durability.},

Exposure of these objects to aggressive environmental conditions, together with me­ chanical actions, can lead to deterioration and ultimate destruction. In the present study, a 3D hygro-mechanical meso-scale model for wood is formulated and implemented into the 3D finite element code MASA.

	abstract = {The quality control of wood products is often only checked at the end of the production process so that countermeasures can only be taken with a time delay in the event of fluctuations in product quality. This often leads to unnecessary and cost-intensive rejects. Furthermore, since quality control often requires additional procedural steps to be performed by a skilled worker, testing is time-consuming and costly. While traditional machine learning (ML) methods based on supervised learning have been used in the field with some success, the limited availability of labeled data is the major hurdle for further improving model performance. In the present study, the potential of enhancing the performance of the ML methods random forest (RF) and support vector machines (SVM) for quality classification by using semi-supervised learning (SSL) was investigated. Labeled and unlabeled data were provided by Swiss Wood Solutions AG, which produces densified wood for high-value wood products such as musical instruments. The developed approach includes labeling of the unlabeled data using SSL, training and 10k cross-validation of the ML algorithms RF and SVM, and determining the generalization ability using the hold-out test set. Based on the evaluation indices such as accuracy, F1-score, recall, false-positive-rate and confusion matrices, it was shown that SSL could enhance the prediction performance of the quality classification of ML models compared to the conventional supervised learning method. Despite having a small dataset, the work paves the way for future applications of SSL for wood quality assessment.},

For this purpose, a database containing 642 data-records of ﬁeld exposure data of Cs (along with the associated mixture proportion parameters, environmental conditions and exposure time) is established based on extensive literature surveying, which covers splash, tidal, and submerged zones in various areas in the world. The database is used to train ﬁve standalone ML models, that is, linear regression (LR), Gaussian process regression (GPR), support vector machine (SVM), multilayer perceptron artiﬁcial neural network (MLP-ANN) and random forests (RF) models, as well as an ensemble weighted votingbased ML model, and subsequently used to compare their prediction performances. It is shown that, by metaheuristically combining predictions of RF, MLP-ANN, and SVM, the ensemble ML model produces higher accuracy of prediction compared to all standalone ML models tested in this study. The prediction performances of eight conventional quantitative models for Cs prediction are also analyzed based on the testing dataset selected for ML. The results show that adoption of more diverse datasets and consideration of more factors in conventional models can improve their prediction performance. The ensemble ML model established on a large database, can easily consider the twelve inﬂuencing factors (which is diﬃcult for conventional models) in the database, and has superior prediction performance, yet better time-eﬃciency, compared to conventional models.},

	abstract = {Pavement crack detected plays an important role in pavement maintenance. Image recognition is a traditional way for pavement crack detected. Recently, deep learning is a stateof-the-art method for target detection. CNN (convolutional neural network), a significant method in deep learning, is widely used in image target detection and brings about breakthroughs. However, CNN has not been applied to pavement crack detection. In this paper, we apply CNN to detect pavement crack and PCA (Principal Component Analysis) to classify the detected pavement cracks. Firstly, two databases are obtained by using two different scales of grid (32×32, 64×64) to segment pavement images. Each database has 30000 images for training set. We obtain two kinds of trained CNN. Each CNN is trained by one training set, which is part of each scale databases. We use trained CNN to detect the existence of pavement crack in corresponding scale grids. We confirm the scale of segment grid by comparing the results of pavement crack detected. Secondly, we only keep the grids containing crack and achieve the skeleton of crack in a pavement image. Lastly, we use PCA to analyse the skeleton of crack. The classification of crack can be obtained. The F-measure for crack detection is 94.7\%. Meanwhile, the proposed method achieves 97.2\%, 97.6\% and 90.1\% correct rate of classification for longitudinal crack, transverse crack and alligator crack, respectively. The results show proposed method can detect the pavement crack and evaluate the type of crack precisely.},

	abstract = {Clients are increasingly looking for fast and effective means to quickly and frequently survey and communicate the condition of their buildings so that essential repairs and maintenance work can be done in a proactive and timely manner before it becomes too dangerous and expensive. Traditional methods for this type of work commonly comprise of engaging building surveyors to undertake a condition assessment which involves a lengthy site inspection to produce a systematic recording of the physical condition of the building elements, including cost estimates of immediate and projected long-term costs of renewal, repair and maintenance of the building. Current asset condition assessment procedures are extensively time consuming, laborious, and expensive and pose health and safety threats to surveyors, particularly at height and roof levels which are difficult to access. This paper aims at evaluating the application of convolutional neural networks (CNN) towards an automated detection and localisation of key building defects, e.g., mould, deterioration, and stain, from images. The proposed model is based on pre-trained CNN classifier of VGG-16 (later compaired with ResNet-50, and Inception models), with class activation mapping (CAM) for object localisation. The challenges and limitations of the model in real-life applications have been identified. The proposed model has proven to be robust and able to accurately detect and localise building defects. The approach is being developed with the potential to scale-up and further advance to support automated detection of defects and deterioration of buildings in real-time using mobile devices and drones.},

Reinforced concrete buildings are modelled as single-degree-of-freedom systems and various time-history nonlinear analyses are performed to create a dataset of damage indices. Subsequently, two decision trees are trained using the qualitative interpretations of those indices. The ﬁrst decision tree determines whether damage occurs in an RC building. Consequently, the second decision tree predicts the severity of damage as repairable, beyond repair, or collapse.},

The existing local connection damage identification methods require expensive instrumentation and the sensors at a specific location. That is why, artificial intelligence (AI) has become very popular and has come up with better alternatives, efficiency which can overcome the shortcomings of traditional vibration-based connection damage identification techniques. As per the current literature, most of the AI-based techniques that use experimentally generated damage data suffer the paucity of appropriate and quality dataset corresponding to different damage conditions. Hence the authors have proposed a model-based scheme for evaluating the health condition of steel structural connection in such cases, which uses a combination of Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and Continuous Wavelet Transform (CWT) of the response signal. The method requires only global vibration signals from impulse excitation on the structure and subsequently the updated finite element (FE) model of steel structure considering connection flexibility can be utilized for multiple functionalities. For experimental validation of the proposed methodology, a two-story structural steel frame has been considered. The performance of the proposed methodology is further verified and validated through the identification of beam-column connection damage additionally introduced in the test frame.},

In this article, we propose a novel improved Isolation Forest (IIF) algorithm based on the assumption that anomaly pixels are more susceptible to isolation than background pixels. The proposed IIF is a modiﬁed version of the Isolation Forest (iForest) algorithm, which addresses the poor performance of iForest in detecting local anomalies and anomaly detection in high-dimensional data. Furthermore, we propose a spectral–spatial anomaly detector based on IIF (SSIIFD) to make full use of global and local information, as well as spectral and spatial information. To be speciﬁc, ﬁrst, we apply the Gabor ﬁlter to extract spatial features, which are then employed as input to the relative mass isolation forest (ReMass-iForest) detector to obtain the spatial anomaly score. Next, original images are divided into several homogeneous regions via the entropy rate segmentation (ERS) algorithm, and the preprocessed images are then employed as input to the proposed IIF detector to obtain the spectral anomaly score. Finally, we fuse the spatial and spectral anomaly scores by combining them linearly to predict anomaly pixels. The experimental results on four real hyperspectral datasets demonstrate that the proposed detector outperforms other state-of-the-art methods.},

	abstract = {This study presented an unsupervised anomaly detection-based framework for distributed damage detection in concrete using ultrasonic response signals. A deep fully connected auto-encoder was employed to reconstruct the ultrasonic response signals. This model was trained on the intact specimen’s responses. The auto-encoder demonstrated a relatively high prediction error encountering the damaged specimen’s responses. Two time-domain features (mean squared error and reconstructed-to-original signal ratio) and one frequency-domain feature (fundamental amplitude ratio) were defined to measure the reconstruction error of the auto-encoder (the damage-sensitive features). Finally, the Isolation Forest algorithm was implemented for anomaly (damage) detection. The beauty of this framework is that it requires a few numbers of data only from the intact specimen for training the auto-encoder and collecting the binary decision trees of the Isolation Forest. The framework was successfully implemented for damage detection in five geopolymer concrete specimens with different mix proportions. Using all three introduced damage-sensitive features, the framework demonstrated an average prediction accuracy of 95.0\% and 93.0\% for damaged and intact stages, respectively.},

Performance based service life assessment of wood is largely comprised of two parts: (1) establishing the relationship between the environmental conditions and the material climate, and (2) establishing the relationship between the material climate and the rate of deterioration. The former depends on factors such as weather parameters, material properties and the design of details.{\textbackslash}textlessbr/{\textbackslash}textgreater{\textbackslash}textlessbr/{\textbackslash}textgreaterTwo experimental trials were conducted in order to acquire data concerning the relationship between the environmental conditions and the moisture content of the wood. The aim of the first experiment was to study typical details utilized for timber bridges with respect to their variation in moisture content. The type of detailing employed was shown to have a great effect on the moisture conditions, with the exposed contact areas and the end-grain being subject to increased levels of moisture content. The second experiment focused on the effects of long-term superficial damage on the moisture conditions of wood. It was shown that superficial damage caused by photo degradation and checking lead to increased moisture absorption and consequently to a longer duration of surface wetness. {\textbackslash}textlessbr/{\textbackslash}textgreater{\textbackslash}textlessbr/{\textbackslash}textgreaterThe relationship between environmental conditions and material climate was estimated through numerical modelling, which involves the explicit modelling of moisture transport within the wooden member and the exchange of moisture at the surfaces that are exposed.

In impact-echo test, surface motion generated by short-duration mechanical impact is investigated for structural condition assessment. This paper endeavours to formulate impact echo analysis by using novel statistical techniques, i.e. Grassmann manifold learning. Comparing to conventional impact-echo test, the proposed method presents several favourable properties: 1. Conventional impact-echo method mostly relies on frequency peak in echo spectrum, the proposed method characterizes rich temporal-spectral patterns in addition to the spectral peak. 2. Proposed method is performed over local area on concrete surface with integration of several consecutive echo responses, and thus produces more stable condition evaluation result comparing to point-wise impact-echo approach. 3. To cope with extracted echo feature, effective similarity metric on Grassmann manifold is employed, which favourably facilities condition-based assessment. To demonstrate the proposed method, we prepared concrete specimen with 2cm, 4cm and 6cm depth void inside and echo signal is captured through air-coupled sensor. Experimental result demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed method, including accurate condition-based classification performance and high processing efficiency},

	abstract = {Traditional quantitative risk assessment methods (e.g., event tree analysis) are static in nature, i.e., the risk indexes are assessed before operation, which prevents capturing time-dependent variations as the components and systems operate, age, fail, are repaired and changed. To address this issue, we develop a dynamic risk assessment (DRA) method that allows online estimation of risk indexes using data collected during operation. Two types of data are considered: statistical failure data, which refer to the counts of accidents or near misses from similar systems and condition-monitoring data, which come from online monitoring the degradation of the target system of interest. For this, a hierarchical Bayesian model is developed to compute the reliability of the safety barriers and a Bayesian updating algorithm, which integrates particle filtering (PF) with Markov Chain Monte Carlo, is developed to update the reliability evaluations based on both the statistical and condition-monitoring data. The updated safety barriers reliabilities, are, then, used in an event tree (ET) for consequence analysis and the risk indexes are updated accordingly. A case study on a high-flow safety system is conducted to demonstrate the developed methods. A comparison to the DRA method which only uses statistical failure data shows that by introducing condition-monitoring data on the system degradation process, it is possible to capture the system-specific characteristics, and, therefore, provide a more complete and accurate description of the risk of the target system.},

	abstract = {Background: Defect detection and segmentation on product surfaces in industry has become one of the most important steps in quality control. There are many sophisticated hardware and software tools used in the industry for this purpose. The need for the real-time classification and detection of defects in industrial quality control has become a crucial requirement. Most algorithms and deep neural network architectures require expensive hardware to perform inference in real-time. This necessitates the design of architectures that are light-weight and suitable for deployment in industrial environments. Methods: In this study, we introduce a novel method for detecting wood planks on a fast-moving conveyor and using a convolutional neural network (CNN) to segment surface defects in real-time. A backbone network is trained with a large-scale image dataset. A dataset of 5000 images is created with proper annotation of wood planks and defects. In addition, a data augmentation technique is employed to enhance the accuracy of the model. Furthermore, we examine both statistical and deep learning-based approaches to identify and separate defects using the latest methods. Results: Our plank detection method achieved an impressive mean average precision of 97\% and 96\% of global pixel accuracy for defect segmentation. This remarkable performance is made possible by the real-time processing capabilities of our system, which can run at 30 frames per second (FPS) without sacrificing accuracy. Conclusions: The results of our study demonstrate the potential of our method not only in industrial wood processing applications but also in other industries where materials undergo similar processes of defect detection and segmentation. By utilizing our method, these industries can expect to see improved efficiency, accuracy, and overall productivity.},

	abstract = {The principal bioactive phenolic component of ginger (Zingiber officinale Rosc.) rhizome is 6-gingerol, which is known to have several sensory and therapeutic properties. Due to its antimicrobial, anti-biofilm, anti-cancer, and anti-inflammatory properties, a sizable global market for ginger has been generated. The variation in yield of 6-gingerol is observed with changes in environmental, agronomic, and genetic conditions. The current study aims to examine how environmental and climatic factors affect 6-gingerol content using an artificial neural network (ANN) model and predict a new location to produce 6-gingerol. ANN-based models; MLP (multilayer perceptron) and RBF (radial basis function) with the desirable learning algorithms, transfer functions, number of neurons, and hidden layers were designed. The dataset of 60 unique Zingiber officinale rhizomes obtained from ten agro-climatic zones of Odisha was included in this study. The content of 6-gingerol was ascertained using a high-performance thin-layer chromatography (HPTLC) technique. The experimental dataset was randomly divided into 70 \% for training, 15 \% for testing, and 15 \% for validation to carry out the optimization. In 60 accessions from various locations of Odisha, the concentration of 6-gingerol in ginger rhizomes ranged from 0.203 \% to 0.813 \% on a wet weight basis. It was revealed that the ANN model with the MLP algorithm was superior to the RBF algorithm. The findings showed that an ANN-MLP architecture with a single hidden layer of 11 neurons and a 16–11–1 topology could accurately predict the content of 6-gingerol, with an R2 (coefficient of determination) of 0.99. Altitude, pH, maximum temperature, and phosphorus were identified as the factors that influenced the model's prediction accuracy, which was 95 \%. The content of 6-gingerol was enhanced from 0.363 \% to 0.408 \% by regulating the present model's sensitive parameters. The current study concluded that the developed ANN model efficiently predicts the best region for optimum 6-gingerol yield.},

Both network architectures are compared to assess their suitability in the process of a hot flow curve description under a wide range of thermomechanical conditions. The performed survey is also aimed on the eventual utilization of corresponding modifications of both studied networks, namely on a Cascade-Forward Multi-Layer Perceptron and Generalized Regression network. The main results have shown that the Feed-Forward Multi-Layer Perceptron architecture represents a good choice if very high accuracy is a crucial goal. However, in the case of this architecture, finding the proper parameters can be time-consuming and the hardware burdensome. On the contrary, for the flow curve description the almost unused Radial Basis network offers a very easy training procedure and significantly shorter computing time under acceptable accuracy. The results of the submitted research should then serve as a background for the selection and following application of a suitable network architecture in the process of solving future flow curve description tasks.},

Infinite-horizon Q-learning is also increasingly relevant in the growing field of mobile health.

In this article, we (a) review the history of Q-learning in computer science and statistics, (b) formalize finite-horizon Q-learning within the potential outcomes framework and discuss the inferential difficulties for which it is infamous, and (c) review variants of infinite-horizon Q-learning and the exploration-exploitation problem, which arises in decision problems with a long time horizon.

Adopting a dynamical systems perspective, we provide a theoretical analysis of a popular version of Deep Q-Learning under realistic and verifiable assumptions. More specifically, we prove an important result on the convergence of the algorithm, characterizing the asymptotic behavior of the learning process. Our result sheds light on hitherto unexplained properties of the algorithm and helps understand empirical observations, such as performance inconsistencies even after training. Unlike previous theories, our analysis accommodates state Markov processes with multiple stationary distributions.

In this paper, we propose a framework which uses the Max-Mean loss in Deep Q-Network (M{\textbackslash}ˆ2{\textbackslash}DQN). Instead of sampling one batch of experiences in the training step, we sample several batches from the experience replay and update the parameters such that the maximum TD-error of these batches is minimized.

We verify the effectiveness of this framework with one of the most widely used techniques, Double DQN (DDQN), in several gym games.

	abstract = {The deep Q-network (DQN) is one of the most successful reinforcement learning algorithms, but it has some drawbacks such as slow convergence and instability. In contrast, the traditional reinforcement learning algorithms with linear function approximation usually have faster convergence and better stability, although they easily suffer from the curse of dimensionality. In recent years, many improvements to DQN have been made, but they seldom make use of the advantage of traditional algorithms to improve DQN. In this paper, we propose a novel Q-learning algorithm with linear function approximation, called the minibatch recursive least squares Q-learning (MRLS-Q). Different from the traditional Q-learning algorithm with linear function approximation, the learning mechanism and model structure of MRLS-Q are more similar to those of DQNs with only one input layer and one linear output layer. It uses the experience replay and the minibatch training mode and uses the agent’s states rather than the agent’s state-action pairs as the inputs. As a result, it can be used alone for low-dimensional problems and can be seamlessly integrated into DQN as the last layer for high-dimensional problems as well. In addition, MRLS-Q uses our proposed average RLS optimization technique, so that it can achieve better convergence performance whether it is used alone or integrated with DQN. At the end of this paper, we demonstrate the effectiveness of MRLS-Q on the CartPole problem and four Atari games and investigate the influences of its hyperparameters experimentally.},

In total 117 comparisons were drawn between data from both types of durability testing from which the acceleration and deceleration factors were derived. It was found that for usual WPC formulations weatherometer trials according to EN ISO 4892 represent 7.35 times longer periods under natural conditions. Further, the quality of data was an enabler for the development of algorithms which comprehensively detected that lifespan for 30\%-fiber loaded compounds is 1.7-times longer compared to those with 45\% fiber share.

Due to the fact that destructive methods are not suitable for historical buildings of great architectural significance, a non-destructive method based on electrical tomography has been adopted.

This device enables the acquisition of data, which are then reconstructed by appropriately developed methods enabling spatial analysis of wet buildings. Special electrodes that ensure good contact with the surface of porous building materials such as bricks and cement were introduced. During the research, a group of algorithms enabling supervised machine learning was analyzed. They have been used in the process of converting input electrical values into conductance depicted by the output image pixels. The conductance values of individual pixels of the output vector made it possible to obtain images of the interior of building walls as both flat intersections (2D) and spatial (3D) images. The presented group of algorithms has a high application value. The main advantages of the new methods are: high accuracy of imaging, low costs, high processing speed, ease of application to walls of various thickness and irregular surface. By comparing the results of tomographic reconstructions, the most efficient algorithms were identified.},

	abstract = {Methods employed for surveying buildings for condition have traditionally been reliant upon visual assessment and manual recording. Survey of traditional masonry also ostensibly conforms to this approach but, due to the sheer volume of masonry units composing walls, it is often prohibitively time consuming, exceptionally complex and ultimately costly. Notable features of such survey work for ashlar stone types require each stone to be labelled and overlaid with information relative to condition. Further hindering these already costly operations, it has been shown that the accuracy of reporting, including labelling the manifestation of defects and defect diagnosis, is subjective, depending upon the expertise and experience of those evaluating the fabric. Moving beyond these preliminary survey and reporting stages, this situation gives rise to variable repair and maintenance strategies that can have significant cost implications and can debase fundamental conservation activities. The development of digital technologies, such as terrestrial laser scanning, and advancements in novel computer vision statistical techniques can help produce accurate representation of buildings that can be subsequently rapidly processed, achieving many tangible survey functions with greater inherent objectivity. In this paper, an innovative strategy for automatic detection and classification of defects in digitised ashlar masonry walling is presented. The classification method is based on the use of supervised machine learning algorithms, assisted by surveyors' strategies and expertise to identify defective individual masonry units, through to broader global patterns for groups of stones. The proposed approach has been tested on the main façade of the Chapel Royal in Stirling Castle (Scotland), demonstrating its potential for ashlar masonry forms of wall construction. It is important to recognise that the findings are not limited to this culturally significant building and will be of high value to almost innumerable ashlar-built structures worldwide. The research ultimately attempts to reduce the degree of subjectivity in classifying defects, on a scale and rapidity hitherto beyond traditional project cost constraints. Importantly, it is recognised that through automation more effective utilisation of resources that would have been traditionally spent on survey can be redeployed to support fabric intervention or routine maintenance operations.},

	abstract = {In concrete structures, surface cracks are important indicators of structural durability and serviceability. Generally, concrete cracks are visually monitored by inspectors who record crack information such as the existence, location, and width. Manual visual inspection is often considered ineffective in terms of cost, safety, assessment accuracy, and reliability. Digital image processing has been introduced to more accurately obtain crack information from images. A critical challenge is to automatically identify cracks from an image containing actual cracks and crack-like noise patterns (e.g. dark shadows, stains, lumps, and holes), which are often seen in concrete structures. This article presents a methodology for identifying concrete cracks using machine learning. The method helps in determining the existence and location of cracks from surface images. The proposed approach is particularly designed for classifying cracks and noncrack noise patterns that are otherwise difficult to distinguish using existing image processing algorithms. In the training stage of the proposed approach, image binarization is used to extract crack candidate regions; subsequently, classification models are constructed based on speeded-up robust features and convolutional neural network. The obtained crack identification methods are quantitatively and qualitatively compared using new concrete surface images containing cracks and noncracks.},

	abstract = {The impact-echo (IE) method is a popular non-destructive testing (NDT) technique widely used for measuring the thickness of plate-like structures and for detecting certain defects inside concrete elements or structures. However, the IE method is not effective for full condition assessment (i.e., defect detection, defect diagnosis, defect sizing and location), because the simple frequency spectrum analysis involved in the existing IE method is not sufficient to capture the IE signal patterns associated with different conditions. In this paper, we attempt to enhance the IE technique and enable it for full condition assessment of concrete elements by introducing advanced machine learning techniques for performing comprehensive analysis and pattern recognition of IE signals. Specifically, we use wavelet decomposition for extracting signatures or features out of the raw IE signals and apply extreme learning machine, one of the recently developed machine learning techniques, as classification models for full condition assessment. To validate the capabilities of the proposed method, we build a number of specimens with various types, sizes, and locations of defects and perform IE testing on these specimens in a lab environment. Based on analysis of the collected IE signals using the proposed machine learning based IE method, we demonstrate that the proposed method is effective in performing full condition assessment of concrete elements or structures.},

	abstract = {The nuclear industry is exploring applications of Artificial Intelligence (AI), including autonomous control and management of reactors and components. A condition assessment framework that utilizes AI and sensor data is an important part of such an autonomous control system. A nuclear power plant has various structures, systems, and components (SSCs) such as piping-equipment that carries coolant to the reactor. Piping systems can degrade over time because of flow-accelerated corrosion and erosion. Any cracks and leakages can cause loss of coolant accident (LOCA). The current industry standards for conducting maintenance of vital SSCs can be time and cost-intensive. AI can play a greater role in the condition assessment and can be extended to recognize concrete degradation (chloride-induced damage and alkali–silica reaction) before cracks develop. This paper reviews developments in condition assessment and AI applications of structural and mechanical systems. The applicability of existing techniques to nuclear systems is somewhat limited because its response requires characterization of high and low-frequency vibration modes, whereas previous studies focus on systems where a single vibration mode can define the degraded state. Data assimilation and storage is another challenging aspect of autonomous control. Advances in AI and data mining world can help to address these challenges.},

	abstract = {This paper presents a machine-learning-based approach for the structural health monitoring (SHM) of in-situ timber utility poles based on guided wave (GW) propagation. The proposed non-destructive testing method combines a new multi-sensor testing system with advanced statistical signal processing techniques and state-of-the-art machine learning algorithms for the condition assessment of timber utility poles. Currently used pole inspection techniques have critical limitations including the inability to assess the underground section. GW methods, on the other hand, are techniques potentially capable of evaluating non-accessible areas and of detecting internal damage. However, due to the lack of solid understanding on the GW propagation in timber poles, most methods fail to fully interpret wave patterns from field measurements. The proposed method utilises an innovative multi-sensor testing system that captures wave signals along a sensor array and it applies machine learning algorithms to evaluate the soundness of a pole. To validate the new method, it was tested on eight in-situ timber poles. After the testing, the poles were dismembered to determine their actual health states. Various state-of-the-art machine learning algorithms with advanced data pre-processing were applied to classify the poles based on the wave measurements. It was found that using a support vector machine classifier, with the GW signals transformed into autoregressive coefficients, achieved a very promising maximum classification accuracy of 95.7±3.1\% using 10-fold cross validation on multiple training and testing instances. Using leave-one-out cross validation, a classification accuracy of 93.3±6.0\% for bending wave and 85.7±10.8\% for longitudinal wave excitation was achieved.},

In this study, we propose a novel hammering response analysis system using online machine learning, which aims at achieving near-human performance in assessment of concrete structures. Current computerized hammer sounding systems commonly employ lab-scale data to validate the models. In practice, however, the response signal patterns can be far more complicated due to varying geometric shapes and materials of structures. To deal with a large variety of unseen data, we propose a sequential treatment for response characterization. More specifically, the proposed system can adaptively update itself to approach human performance in hammering sounding data interpretation. To this end, a two-stage framework has been introduced, including feature extraction and the model updating scheme. Various state-of-the-art online learning algorithms have been reviewed and evaluated for the task. To conduct experimental validation, we collected 10,940 response instances from multiple inspection sites; each sample was annotated by human experts with healthy/defective condition labels. The results demonstrated that the proposed scheme achieved favorable assessment accuracy with high efficiency and low computation load.},

	abstract = {The load resisting capacity of structural members will decrease when they are subjected to long-term sustained load. Such phenomenon is widely known as the duration of load effect, which is mainly caused by the damage accumulation in the material. The deterioration mechanism of the material is a typical stochastic process which is influenced by a large variety of parameters involving complex physical and chemical process. Although classical models have been proposed to evaluate the duration of load effect, it is nearly impossible to quantify the influence of various parameters and to achieve an accurate estimation. To optimize the combination of complexity and goodness-of-fit, a neural network model is proposed in this paper to evaluate the duration of load effect in wood structural members. Taking individual uncertainties into consideration, the proposed model treats the damage in wood as a Markov process and can estimate the residual strength distribution of the investigated wood structural members under long-term sustained load. The coefficient of determination reaches above 95\% under sustained loading scenario, and it shows good adaptability across different wood properties. Moreover, the model can be adapted to continuously varied loading scenarios with a 98\% coefficient of determination. This research aims to provide a useful and straightforward tool for accurately predicting the duration of load effect in wood structural members, and the proposed algorithm can be easily modified to deal with similar engineering problems for other construction materials.},

Purpose: to determine whether the limits of the sensitivity of the statistical distribution of the mechanical characteristics have been computed using the maximum likelihood method. Value: there is a certain upward and downward flattening of the probability curves in the statistical distribution curves of the fatigue test results. This implies that the chosen law of the distribution of random variables has an effect on the appearance of errors. These errors are unacceptable given the importance of accurately determining the reliability and durability of transport means, shipbuilding, machinery, and other important structures. Our results could potentially explain why sensitive limits cannot be applied to the statistical distribution of the mechanical characteristics of structural materials.},

A multi-regression (MR) model was also utilised to study the effects of curing time and content of OPC, GGBS and HCFA on the mortars’ strength and to identify the relationship between measured and predicted compressive strengths. The results indicated that the newly developed binder was composed of 35 wt\% OPC, 35 wt\% GGBS and 30 wt\% HCFA that showed a compressive strength and surface electrical resistivity of 30.8 MPa and 103.5 kΩ.cm after 56 days of curing, respectively. Significant changes in the microstructure of the developed binder paste over curing time were evidenced by SEM imaging. The statistical analysis indicated that the influence of the parameters examined on the development of the mortars’ compressive strength could be modelled with a coefficient of determination, R2 of 0.893, and that the relative importance of these parameters followed the order curing time (t) {\textbackslash}textgreater HCFA\% {\textbackslash}textgreater OPC\% {\textbackslash}textgreater GGBS\%.

	abstract = {In recent years, the number of reinforced concrete structures with anomalies associated with reinforcement corrosion problems has significantly increased. One of the causes is concrete carbonation which occurs when carbon dioxide (CO2) penetrates the concrete’s porous system to create an environment with lower pH around the reinforcement in which corrosion can proceed. Several analytical models describe the relationship between carbonation depth and concrete age, of which the most frequently used results from Fick’s first law: x=Kt, where K is the carbonation coefficient. This coefficient depends on environmental conditions such as CO2 concentration and humidity and concrete characteristics like w/c ratio, type of cement, and so it varies significantly from one structure to another. A statistical study is presented in this paper to enable a better evaluation of K in open air concrete structures. The study is based on the results of over 100 measurements taken on existing structures up to 99years old. The results were statistically analysed to obtain correlations between K and factors such as structure age, the effect of painting, concrete compressive strength and exposure conditions. This analysis allowed recommendations for the covering of reinforcing bars to be made at design level.},

In this paper, NDT measurements from GPR, electrical resistivity and ultrasonic pulse velocity were combined to predict more accurately concrete properties such as strength and water content. Two techniques of data fusion were used namely Response Surface Method (RSM) and artificial neural networks (ANNs). The results obtained show the effectiveness of the statistical modeling to predict the properties of concretes by fusion of NDT measurements. In the context of this study, the performances of the two techniques of fusion appear relevant in terms of water content and concrete strength prediction.

The panels were tested as-they-were – no initial sterilization or particular test microorganisms were used. The tested panels showed notable growth of different types of moulds. The main mould occurred from the Genus Aspergillus what is considered as xerophilic. Under the optical microscope the network of fungal mycelium was detected also on panels what did not show visible growth. Environmentally friendly wood-based panels are very susceptible to the surface mould development whenever the favourable moisture conditions appear. The RH for the development of xerophilic moulds is relatively low –– about 75\% RH, what is rather common condition in the construction site.

Therefore, during the last two decades, interest in applying this tool in the construction field has increased, and the number of articles and studies has risen exponentially. However, there is a lack of consolidated studies that provide insights into the implementation of LCA on construction and demolition waste (C\&DW). To fill this research gap, this study presents a literature review analysis to consolidate the most relevant topics and issues in the research field of C\&DW materials and how LCA has been implemented during the last two decades. A systematic literature search was performed following the PRISMA method: analysis of selected works is based on bibliometric and content-based approaches. As a result, the study characterized 150 selected works in terms of the evolution of articles per year, geographical distribution, most relevant research centers, and featured sources. In addition, this study highlights research gaps in terms of methodological and design tools to improve LCA analysis, indicators, and connection to new trending concepts, such as circular economy and industry 4.0.},

	abstract = {This study investigated the factors affecting the carbonation of alkali-activated slag concrete (AASC). Concrete durability plays an important role in the longevity of concrete structures, but aggressive chemical agents can leave major undesirable impacts on the durability of concrete. One of such chemical agents is CO2 gas, whose penetration into concrete leads to a carbonation process which facilitates the electrochemical corrosion of steel reinforcements. One of the weaknesses of alkali-activated slag concrete in comparison with Portland cement concrete is its lower resistance against carbonation. Thus, in this paper, we studied the effect of such parameters as alkaline solution to slag ratio, partial replacement of slag with microsilica, compressive strength, and curing method on the carbonation of alkali-activated slag concrete. The samples were subjected to accelerated carbonation by being placed in a CO2 gas chamber for two cycles of 14 and 28 days, and then the resulting depth of carbonation was measured and analyzed. A sample of ordinary Portland cement concrete was used as the control sample. The SEM images taken from the samples were studied to determine the changes in the structure of the cement paste. The results showed that the replacement of 15\% of slag with microsilica has a significant positive effect on the carbonation depth of alkali-activated slag concrete. Compared with the exponential relationships offered for ordinary concrete in the literature, the relationship between compressive strength and carbonation depth of AAS concrete was linear. The results showed that carbonation depth decreases with increase in compressive strength and decrease in AAS concrete permeability.},

This study addresses the underutilization of Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) in the construction sector and demonstrates its benefits as a decision-making tool for mitigating embodied carbon. The research focuses on a G+2 building in Dubai, UAE, conducting LCA during the construction phases to assess embodied carbon levels. Results indicate that the careful selection of construction materials and involvement of LCA at the early stages of construction resulted in a 26 \% reduction in the building's embodied carbon. The study recognizes the limitations of LCA but emphasizes its value and recommends future research to enhance its coverage of sustainability aspects. The findings highlight the construction sector's potential to overcome anthropogenic challenges through green solutions. Policymakers' support is crucial for implementing strategies that reduce the construction industry's carbon footprint and embrace a circular economy. The study contributes to the literature by bridging the gap in understanding the application of LCA in construction decision-making. It emphasizes the importance of transitioning to sustainable practices and circularity in the construction sector. By using LCA as a tool, construction professionals can make informed choices to reduce embodied carbon. This study underscores the urgency for adopting greener practices in the construction sector, leading to a more sustainable and low-carbon future.},

To enhance the utilization of waste materials, minimize cement consumption, and fabricate artificial aggregates with superior comprehensive performance, we designed and synthesized alkali-activated aggregates (AAAs) in this study. This study used MSWIBA and ground granulated blast furnace slag (GGBFS) as precursors for alkali-activated aggregates (AAAs), activated by a mixture of sodium hydroxide solutions and sodium silicate. The physical and mechanical prop­ erties of AAAs, including water absorption, apparent density, crushing strength and carbon-resistance, were investigated at different NaOH concentrations. In addition, the microstructure, mineral composition, aggrega­ tion, porosity and heavy metal leaching behavior of AAAs were analyzed by SEM, XRD, FTIR, TGA, MIP and ICP techniques. All AAAs exhibited a consistent particle size distribution, characterized by apparent densities spanning the range of 1633–1940 kg/m3. The leaching levels of heavy metals align with the standards estab­ lished by Chinese regulations. Among the different activator concentrations tested, aggregate (M4) displayed superior single-particle crushing strength (3.90 MPa) and better carbonization resistance. It also used a lower concentration of NaOH, which enabled more cost-effective and eco-friendly production. Overall, the findings suggest that MSWIBA can be a viable precursor for producing sustainable lightweight concrete, with 4 M NaOH being the optimal activator concentration for achieving the best performance.},

Recent studies have, however, highlighted the problems related to uncertainties in the LCA results. The aim of this study is to assess the sensitivity of construction materials to the different modelling choices in order to highlight their consequences at the building scale. In particular, we focused on the different modelling options in terms of database choices, system boundary definitions and replacement scenarios of building materials during the whole service life of the buildings. The assessment of uncertainties was conducted at two levels: the material or element level and the building level. The results clearly show the importance of these modelling choices. Variations on the overall assessment of buildings are significant, but the details at the material scale show that not all materials are similarly sensitive to these choices. We identified those materials that have a large contribution to the environmental impact of the buildings and which are also sensitive to different modelling choices. This can help for a better understanding of these modelling choices and can be used in upcoming regulations or public policies.},

	abstract = {This paper presents a literature review on the effects of accelerated carbonation on alkali-activated materials. It attempts to provide a greater understanding of the influence of CO2 curing on the chemical and physical properties of various types of alkali-activated binders used in pastes, mortars, and concrete. Several aspects related to changes in chemistry and mineralogy have been carefully identified and discussed, including depth of CO2 interaction, sequestration, reactions with calcium-based phases (e.g., calcium hydroxide and calcium silicate hydrates and calcium aluminosilicate hydrates), as well as other aspects related to the chemical composition of alkali-activated materials. Emphasis has also been given to physical alterations such as volumetric changes, density, porosity, and other microstructural properties caused by induced carbonation. Moreover, this paper reviews the influence of the accelerated carbonation curing method on the strength development of alkali-activated materials, which has been awarded little attention considering its potential. This curing technique was found to contribute to the strength development mainly through decalcification of the Ca phases existing in the alkali-activated precursor, leading to the formation of CaCO3, which leads to microstructural densification. Interestingly, this curing method seems to have much to offer in terms of mechanical performance, making it an attractive curing solution that can compensate for the loss in performance caused by less efficient alkali-activated binders replacing Portland cement. Optimising the application of such CO2-based curing methods for each of the potential alkali-activated binders is recommended for future studies for maximum microstructural improvement, and thus mechanical enhancement, to make some of the “low-performing binders” adequate Portland cement substitutes.},

This paper outlines and draws conclusions about different aspects of the material efficiency of buildings and assesses the significance of different building materials on the material efficiency. The research uses an extensive literature study and a case-study in order to assess: should the depletion of materials be ignored in the environmental or sustainability assessment of buildings, are the related effects on land use, energy use and/or harmful emissions significant, should related indicators (such as GHGs) be used to indicate the material efficiency of buildings, and what is the significance of scarce materials, compared to the use of other building materials. This research suggests that the material efficiency should focus on the significant global impacts of material efficiency; not on the individual factors of it. At present global warming and greenhouse gas emissions are among the biggest global problems on which material efficiency has a direct impact on. Therefore, this paper suggests that greenhouse gas emissions could be used as an indicator for material efficiency in building.},

The strength properties such as compressive strength, modulus of elasticity, splitting tensile strength and flexural strength are studied. Durability properties such as water absorption, sorptivity, acid attack resistance and chloride permeability are also determined. The test results showed that up to 25\% of natural crushed stone aggregates in concrete may be replaced with RCA, without significantly affecting the strength of concrete and that the partial replacement of natural aggregates with RCA can be recommended in areas of moderate exposure conditions. Mathematical models developed in the study can be used for the a priori prediction of the strength parameters of RCA concrete.

	abstract = {Several models are available to predict the service life of concrete structures. However, not all models are suitable for use in all the cases, especially for the advanced concrete systems exposed to complex environmental conditions. In addition, all the models do not predict similar results due to various technical merits and demerits. This paper provides a comparative study on four existing service life prediction models (i.e., Life-365™, CHLODIF, ClinConc and DuraCrete). The comparison is based on the predicted corrosion initiation time for various conditions. The merits and demerits of these models are also discussed in brief. Then, the sensitivity of these models to various input parameters (e.g., cover depth, chloride diffusion coefficient, and chloride threshold of steel) in predicting the corrosion initiation time is presented.},

Therefore, it is essential to study and understand phenomena and effects influencing the lifetime of a fastening system. However, the mechanisms are complex and not yet fully understood. As a result, numerical models, which are reliable and are able to capture all involved effects, are needed. The basis of these models is a wide range of high quality data, for model development, calibration, and validation purposes. Within the 7-year Christian Doppler Laboratory (CDL) of Life Cycle Robustness, an extensive concrete data base, consisting of short-term mechanical properties of concrete, time-dependent measurements as well as tests on full fastening systems, was generated. The material tests reach from compression, indirect tensile, and fracture tests to long-term creep and shrinkage tests. Shear and pull-out tests were carried out on bonded and mechanical anchors. In order to characterize the long-term performance, sustained load and time to failure tests were conducted at a system level. In total, 12 concrete mixes were tested. This contribution will give an overview of the performed tests and will highlight the importance of sound experimental data.},

	abstract = {During concrete production, simple and quick testing methods are desired for assessing concrete properties. Non-destructive testing methods, NDT, are particularly valuable in the Quality Assurance and Quality Control (QA/QC) process since do not interfere with production of concrete and reduce testing time and cost. Concrete hardening, and thus strength gain, is one of the most important parameters in concrete production since it can immediately identify potential issues in concrete proportioning, curing conditions, and use of questionable ingredients that affect strength and stiffness. NDTs can provide early warnings in meeting strength requirements at early ages as well as long term strength. NDTs are also valuable in providing strength gain predictions so that follow-up construction can continue once the minimum critical strength is achieved. This research was developed based on the recommendations of a recent national study undertaken by the authors for Federal Highway Administration in developing an NDT based QA process for highway materials. Thus, it was the objective of this research to identify and assess alternative NDT methods that can be used in monitoring and/or estimating strength gain in concrete, and thus for potential adoption an NDT based QA plan. These NDTs should be fast, accurate, reliable and simple to run. The NDT methods explored in this study included: infrared thermography, ultrasonic pulse velocity, and fundamental resonance frequency. The results from such testing methods were coupled with maturity modeling for monitoring and predicting concrete strength at early ages. The results provided good relationships with the maturity index. Even though the relationships of these NDT outputs with the maturity index were based on limited set of experimental data, it is expected that their accuracy will improve with complementary testing on additional concrete mixtures. The methodology of this study is applicable elsewhere where similar materials and construction methods are used.},

A fully connected DNN with 20 input units and 1 output unit trained with a constant learning rate. The network’s inputs describe the laminate layup sequence, lamina properties, and the loading conditions applied to the test specimen, whereas the output is the length of the failure vector.

	abstract = {Synthetic fiber reinforced polymer (FRP) composites are widely used in construction, mechanical engineering, aerospace and automobiles, and other applications where high ratios of mechanical properties relative to mass are required. During the manufacturing, storage, and service, various environmental conditions may affect the long-term performance of FRP composites. A degradation of performance of FRP composites is caused by chemical, physical, and mechanical properties such as temperature, moisture, alkalinity and acidity, ultraviolet radiation, as well as their combinations with mechanical loading in time. In this chapter, the durability of synthetic FRP composites under those above-mentioned environmental conditions is reviewed. The life-prediction approaches for FRP composites are reviewed focusing on the most used concepts such as time-temperature superposition principle (TTSP), and its wide applications through Arrhenius Plots in combination with accelerated aging test data. Accelerated aging test methods aim to assess the “long-term” durability of FRP composites within a short period of time. This is motivated by two aspects: (i) the investigation on realistic long-term performance of FRPs under in-service environmental conditions takes unaffordable time and (ii) the results are nearly impossible to be extended in many cases having different weathering conditions, loading conditions and material characteristics. At the end, the challenges for life predictions of FRP composites are highlighted.},

	abstract = {As an important part of prognostics and health management, remaining useful life (RUL) prediction can provide users and managers with system life information and improve the reliability of maintenance systems. Data-driven methods are powerful tools for RUL prediction because of their great modeling abilities. However, most current data-driven studies require large amounts of labeled training data and assume that the training data and test data follow similar distributions. In fact, the collected data are often variable due to different equipment operating conditions, fault modes, and noise distributions. As a result, the assumption that the training data and the test data obey the same distribution may not be valid. In response to the above problems, this paper proposes a data-driven framework with domain adaptability using a bidirectional gated recurrent unit (BGRU). The framework uses a domain-adversarial neural network (DANN) to implement transfer learning (TL) from the source domain to the target domain, which contains only sensor information. To verify the effectiveness of the proposed method, we analyze the IEEE PHM 2012 Challenge datasets and use them for verification. The experimental results show that the generalization ability of the model is effectively improved through the domain adaptation approach.},

Frequently, several actions develop simultaneously, making it difficult to reproduce in situ conditions in laboratory. Furthermore, testing to assess durability depends largely on the nature of the material itself or on the way it has been assembled with other materials. The ageing techniques to assess long-term durability performance of construction materials are based on accelerated durability tests, which include, for example, thermal stress, freeze–thaw cycles, air pressure, salt crystallization, chemical weathering, and ultraviolet radiation. These tests allow the assessment of the materials’ structural integrity, as well as their aesthetics. In this chapter, the main trends on durability tests on construction materials, such as clay-based, cementitious and polymeric composites, natural stone, metals, wood, and bituminous binders and mixtures, will be presented and discussed.},

The application of statistical and probability methods provides for the possibility of improving the characteristics related to the structural life and the justification for the respective values of cyclic loads in the design stage. Most studies investigating statistical descriptions of crack initiation or complete failure do not analyse the distribution of the characteristics, correlation relationships, and statistical parameters of low-cycle fatigue. Low-cycle failure may be quasistatic or (due to the fatigue) transient. Materials with contrasting cyclic properties were selected for the investigation: cyclically softening alloyed steel 15Cr2MoVA; cyclically stable structural steel C45; cyclically hardening aluminium alloy D16T1. All samples were produced in a single batch of each respective material to reduce the distribution of data. The lowest values of the variation coefficient of one of the key statistical indicators were obtained using the log-normal distribution, which is superior to the normal or Weibull distribution. Statistical analysis of the durability parameters showed that the distribution was smaller than the parameters of the distribution of the deformation diagram. The results obtained in the study enable the verification of durability and life of the structural elements of in-service facilities subjected to elastoplastic loading by assessing the distribution of characteristics of crack initiation and failure and low-cycle strain parameters as well as the permissible distribution limits.},

The causes and mechanisms of the most common processes of deterioration are summarized, the pathologies and influential factors are identified and details given on how information about damaged structures can be collected. The useful information required for assessment is divided into three series of data: those related to the actual material condition, those related to the evolution of damage, and environmental factors.

The effect of various indirect decay factors was found to be reducible to a few direct decay factors, with material resistance, as well as wood moisture content, wood temperature and their dynamics among the key factors for fungal decay. Approaches that consider only indirect factors, e.g. climate indices, suffer from poor correlation with service life or decay rates. Therefore, the overall consideration of all possible influences, reduced on the key direct decay factors in first instance, is recommended.

Then, four samples of each tree were removed, totaling 40 samples, which were later subjected to non-destructive testing of apparent density, ultrasonic wave propagation velocity, dynamic modulus of elasticity obtained by ultrasound, and Janka hardness. These properties were used as estimators of resistance and compressive strength parallel to fibers, and hardness. Multilayer Perceptron networks were also employed, training 100 of them for each of the evaluated parameters. The obtained results indicated that the use of Artificial Neural Networks is an efficient tool for predicting wood resistance.Keywords: Artificial intelligence; Eucalyptus urograndis; hardness; mechanical properties; non-destructive testing.},

Improving efficiency as well as saving labor costs has steadily become a matter of great concern in practice, where deep learning-based algorithms perform better than traditional vision inspection methods in recent years. While existing deep learning-based algorithms are biased towards supervised learning, which not only necessitates a huge amount of labeled data and human labor, but also brings about inefficiency and limitations. In contrast, recent research shows that unsupervised learning has great potential in tackling the above disadvantages for visual industrial anomaly detection. In this survey, we summarize current challenges and provide a thorough overview of recently proposed unsupervised algorithms for visual industrial anomaly detection covering five categories, whose innovation points and frameworks are described in detail. Meanwhile, publicly available datasets for industrial anomaly detection are introduced. By comparing different classes of methods, the advantages and disadvantages of anomaly detection algorithms are summarized. Based on the current research framework, we point out the core issue that remains to be resolved and provide further improvement directions. Meanwhile, based on the latest technological trends, we offer insights into future research directions.

	abstract = {Background: Defect detection and segmentation on product surfaces in industry has become one of the most important steps in quality control. There are many sophisticated hardware and software tools used in the industry for this purpose. The need for the real-time classification and detection of defects in industrial quality control has become a crucial requirement. Most algorithms and deep neural network architectures require expensive hardware to perform inference in real-time. This necessitates the design of architectures that are light-weight and suitable for deployment in industrial environments.
Methods: In this study, we introduce a novel method for detecting wood planks on a fast-moving conveyor and using a convolutional neural network (CNN) to segment surface defects in real-time. A backbone network is trained with a large-scale image dataset. A dataset of 5000 images is created with proper annotation of wood planks and defects. In addition, a data augmentation technique is employed to enhance the accuracy of the model. Furthermore, we examine both statistical and deep learning-based approaches to identify and separate defects using the latest methods.
Results: Our plank detection method achieved an impressive mean average precision of 97\% and 96\% of global pixel accuracy for defect segmentation. This remarkable performance is made possible by the real-time processing capabilities of our system, which can run at 30 frames per second (FPS) without sacrificing accuracy.
Conclusions: The results of our study demonstrate the potential of our method not only in industrial wood processing applications but also in other industries where materials undergo similar processes of defect detection and segmentation. By utilizing our method, these industries can expect to see improved efficiency, accuracy, and overall productivity.},

Well-functioning ‘performance models’ are absolutely essential to predict the service life and functionality of buildings, building assets, and building products over time. Different types of performance models have been established for various building materials, but cannot necessarily transferred to wood-based materials, primarily due to their organic character. For performance modelling of wood products biological agents need to be considered, such as wood disfiguring and degrading organisms. Different approaches to adequately reflect the influence of biotic and abiotic factors on the performance of wood have been reviewed and evaluated with respect to their usability in the building trade. We found that efforts in developing performance models for both fungal decay and mould growth have been intensified in recent years. A high heterogeneity among the numerous attempts became visible, different strategies have been followed, and were roughly distinguished according to the respective objectives, governing variables (e.g. mass loss, strength loss, remaining strength, decay ratings, service life, aesthetic appearance, etc.), data sources and the resulting level of accuracy. A framework of how exposure, dimension, design details, and the material-intrinsic ability to take up and release water can be linked to model the moisture risk in wood products is in principal available. Methods and models have the potential to get implemented not only in design guidelines, but also in European and international standards. In particular, various dosimeter models could serve as reliable tools to quantify the effects of different construction details.},

	abstract = {The aim of this paper is the prediction of the life expectancy of timber balconies to minimise their risk of failure. The life expectancy is estimated considering the effects of fungal attacks on the timber structural elements. The prediction of life expectancy of timber components is set up through (i) the analysis of the state of the art, (ii) the definition of risk classes and decision trees, (iii) the prediction of the decay, (iv) the definition of an inspection procedure, and (v) the development of an adaptive monitoring plan. The the state-of-the-art analysis of the construction details that most affect durability allows for defining the risk classes and decision trees that address all the possible scenarios where water can penetrate the construction detail. The decision trees associate one of the risk classes to the detail under analysis providing a straightforward indication about the exposure of the timber structural elements to decay due to fungal attack. The allocation to a risk class allows the evaluation of the main parameters of a decay prediction model based on functions for estimating the decay rate that are available in the literature. The decay predicted and the inspection results provide the input data to the adaptive motoring plan, defining an efficient program of inspections. Case studies were selected to validate the results of the decay prediction on the outcomes of onsite inspections and to provide sample data for setting the monitoring plan.},

	abstract = {The objective of enterprise building infrastructure management is to provide optimal allocation of maintenance, rehabilitation and replacement (MR\&R) resources and to preserve the condition of building components over a planning horizon. While most approaches have studied it as a finite resource allocation problem, the presence of an underlying building network configuration has been largely ignored. The development of a network model of building components introduces several challenges, as well as opportunities, for MR\&R decision-making and optimized building preservation, which cannot adequately be handled by the existing decision-making frameworks. One such challenge to enterprise building portfolio management is the lack of understanding for the correlation of one component’s condition state to another. Building component network-level optimization is not available as in other infrastructure domains, which makes calculating the benefit of component work activities on other building components very difficult to determine.
This research focuses on using structured query language (SQL) based association rule mining to find frequent patterns of observed condition deterioration among different component types. A new metric, negative effective deterioration, is introduced which is based on actual deterioration observed from inspection data, relative to expected condition states. Frequent patterns of antecedent and consequent component pairs having negative effective deterioration states are discovered, and support and confidence factors indicate the strength of these correlations. 
The building component network model can improve enterprise work planning by considering the effects of negative effective deterioration on other correlated components. This new concept of network-level work optimization is used to identify antecedent component investment opportunities which have a large consequent component payoff by lowering the risk of future preventable deterioration. This process can decrease the long term deferred deficiency backlog by focusing limited MR\&R resources not just on the components in the worst condition, but on those that have the most adverse effect on the condition of associated components. The proposed method can discover a large number of component correlations with negative effective deterioration, which are usually neglected by facility managers, and be able to manage the facility components in the way that predicts unnecessary added deterioration and enable rapid correlation analysis. Furthermore, the correlation of building components is used to present a new approach in determining which components in a building are most critical to require a re-inspection.},

Concrete is made from numerous ingredients that have huge variability either at the design stage or at the testing stage. The main goal of this paper is to quantify the anomalies and outliers during the design phase of concrete mixtures. Concrete mixtures have various percentages of ingredients such as cement, slag, fly ash, water, superplasticizer, fine and coarse aggregates. Machine learning and data mining is considered a very thriving topic in many research fields and its implementation in the construction industry still limited. Concrete community is in need for such a tool to produce an efficient way to efficiently design concrete mixtures. Outliers could occur during the evaluation of samples’ measurements that might include human or system errors. The Local Outlier Factor (LOF) algorithm is the most common method used to determine outliers, however, the LOF has some challenges. In this paper, an anomaly-based outlier detection algorithm called Isolation Forest based on a Sliding window for the Local Outlier Factor (IFS-LOF) algorithm, is proposed to solve the limitations of the LOF in evaluating 1030 concrete mixtures. The proposed algorithm works without any previous knowledge of data distribution and executes the process within limited memory and with minimal computational effort. The evaluation of results proved that the IFS-LOF algorithm is more efficient in detecting the sequence of outliers and provided more efficient accuracy that other state of the art LOF algorithms.},

It is essential to accurately evaluate and predict the evolution of its frost resistance in a complex environment to promote its engineering application. The traditional experimental modeling method is difficult to overcome the complex nonlinearity and environmental sensitivity among concrete components. Therefore, this study employed three classical single ML models, including RG, ANN, and SVR, and three new ensemble learning models (RF, XGBoost, and Stacking) to predict the two indexes of frost resistance of rubberized concrete, i.e., RDEM and MLR. Before modeling, the LOF detection algorithm was used to process the initial dataset to reduce the training bias. In addition, the performance statistics of the above six ML models show that the XGBoost ensemble learning algorithm based on Boosting has the best prediction performance for the frost resistance of rubberized concrete, with more than 95 \% of the predictions distributed within the ± 20 \% confidence interval (R2 = 0.96, MAE = 0.15, RMSE = 0.27). According to the SHAP and the partial dependence analysis, adding an appropriate amount of rubber can improve the frost resistance of concrete. The recommended RC and RS ranges are 15 to 25 kg/m3 and 0.1 to 0.5 mm, respectively. These findings revealed that ML algorithms are an efficient and robust model for predicting rubberized concrete’s frost resistance.},

	abstract = {Statistical and machine learning analysis of structural health monitoring data is a popular approach for efficient structural level defect detection. However, the application of these techniques to stress-wave methods such as impact-echo and impulse-response data for local level detection has been limited. In this research, statistical pattern recognition in conjunction with the impulse-response test is shown to provide an efficient means for the detection of defects in concrete plates. For this purpose, the Frequency Response Function (FRF) derived from the impulse-response test following ASTM C1740 protocols at specific points on the test plate to define the feature space matrix. Analytical results demonstrate that the variability of the FRF increases in the presence of defects, which forms the physical basis for the proposed pattern recognition algorithm. First, Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is performed on the covariance of the feature space matrix to identify the dominant features of the FRFs and to determine the number of statistically significant factors or principal components. Factor scores are next used to identify locations on the plate that are associated most closely to each pattern. The generalized Extreme Value Studentized (ESD) test and box and whisker plots are applied to the factor score vector of all the test points to objectively identify test points with defects and rank these based on their severity. Two experimental specimens are used to demonstrate the applicability of the proposed detection algorithm. The first specimen, a partially reinforced clamped concrete plate, is used to demonstrate the relationship between the shapes and variability of the FRFs and the severity of defects (delaminations), the efficacy of the factor score as damage sensitive feature, and identification and the ranking of the severity of defects by using outlier statistical tests. The second specimen is used to demonstrate the efficiency of the procedure for detecting both void and honeycomb defects in a larger reinforced concrete plate on elastic supports. The proposed procedure is shown to provide similar levels of detectability as the highly refined yet time consuming ultrasonic shear-wave tomography test. While the impulse-response test has been in use for the condition assessment of concrete elements other than drilled shaft piles since 1980′s, defect detection has been based primarily on empirical observations and correlations with limited features of the frequency response function. The use of pattern recognition techniques to the full range of the frequency response function is proposed and shown to greatly improve the detection and characterization of defects.},

	abstract = {Anomaly detection by Mahalanobis-squared distance (MSD) is a popular unsupervised learning approach to structural health monitoring (SHM). Despite the popularity and high applicability of the MSD-based anomaly detection method, some major challenging issues and limitations such as environmental variability, determination of an inappropriate threshold limit, estimation of an inaccurate covariance matrix, and non-Gaussianity of training data may lead to false alarms and erroneous results of damage detection. The main objective of this article is to propose a novel anomaly detection method based on adaptive Mahalanobis-squared distance and one-class kNN rule called AMSD-kNN for SHM under varying environmental conditions. The central idea behind the proposed method is to find sufficient nearest neighbors of training and testing datasets in a two-stage procedure for removing the environmental variability conditions and estimate local covariance matrices. An effective approach based on a multivariate normality hypothesis test is proposed to find sufficient nearest neighbors that guarantee the estimate of well-conditioned local covariance matrices. The great novelty of the proposed AMSD-kNN method is to create a novel unsupervised learning strategy for SHM by a new multivariate distance measure and one-class kNN rule. Generalized extreme value distribution modeling by the block maxima (BM) method is presented to determine an accurate threshold limit. Due to the importance of choosing adequate blocks in the BM method, a goodness-of-fit measure via the Kolmogorov-Smirnov hypothesis test is applied to select an optimal block number. The performance and effectiveness of the proposed methods are verified by two well-known benchmark structures. Several comparative studies are also conducted to demonstrate the superiority of the proposed methods over some state-of-the-art techniques. Results show that the proposed AMSD-kNN and BM methods highly succeed in detecting damage under environmental variability conditions.},

	abstract = {Abstract: The anomalies related with durability of building masonry walls and their confining concrete elements are often related to the occurrence of cracking/detachment and with the presence of moisture. In many situations, it involves the cracking of masonry walls and the deterioration of concrete which, in cases of greater severity, results in the detachment of the walls render and in the local delamination of the concrete elements (columns, walls and beams), with the uncovering of the steel reinforcement and their consequent corrosion. Automated anomalies detection, in inspection of these anomalies, based on image processing techniques, can be done using the non-destructive testing (NDT).
The paper intends to identify the most common anomalies related with durability affecting the functionality and aesthetics and, in some situations, the safety of heritage buildings with reinforced concrete structure, seeking to typify the main anomalies related to the durability of materials and construction elements. A methodology of recognition of the most relevant patterns of these anomalies is briefly presented, in particular through image processing and features extraction of anomaly patterns in facade walls and on confinement elements of reinforced concrete, with the purpose of subsequent use within the framework of support to the inspection actions and consequent maintenance of this type of heritage buildings.},

A convolutional autoencoder was trained as a reconstruction-based model, with the defect-free images, to rapidly and reliably detect defects from the large volume of image datasets. This training process was in the unsupervised mode, with no label needed, thereby requiring no prior knowledge and saving an enormous amount of time for label preparation. The built anomaly detector favors minimizing the reconstruction errors of defect-free images, which renders high reconstruction errors of defects, in turn, detecting the location of defects. The assessment shows that the proposed anomaly detection technique is robust and adaptable to defects on wide ranges of scales. Comparison was also made with the segmentation results produced by other automatic classical methods, revealing that the results made by the anomaly map outperform other segmentation methods, in terms of precision, recall, F1 measure and F2 measure, without severe under- and over-segmentation. Further, instead of merely being a binary map, each pixel of the anomaly map is represented by the anomaly score, which acts as a risk indicator for alerting inspectors, wherever defects on concrete structures are detected.},

The study relies on textual information from inspection reports of 400 schools across Toronto and focuses on roofings due to their higher need for repairs. First, rule-based text mining is used to identify the damage type and extent from the damage descriptions in the inspection reports. Then, unsupervised clustering is used to classify the suggested renewal events into four criticality levels based on the extracted data and other relevant parameters such as age. The proposed framework could identify that only 8.8\% of deteriorated roofs are highly critical and can be funded with the available limited budget. The proposed approach is adaptable to other asset types and components and can substantially improve the fund allocation practice for large owner organizations such as municipalities and school boards.},

In this paper, three methods, namely the piecewise linear least squares (PLLS) method, fully connected neural network (FCNN) method, and long short-term memory neural network (LSTMNN) method, are implemented and compared for structural dynamic response application under the condition of periodic, impact and seismic load. These methods are based on auto-regression model and time series estimation model, and still work when the structure is excited using immeasurable inputs. The dynamic response of a six-story steel frame analysed using the finite element method is used to validate these methods. Experimental results reveal that the PLLS and FCNN methods based on auto-regression model performs less well than the LSTMNN method based on time series estimation model, and it has a large the prediction peak mean square error. In addition, PLLS method is sensitive to noise, but FCNN and LSTMNN method based on deep learning are highly robust and anti-noise performance. These reveal the feasibility of the application of deep learning method in structural behaviours analysis in civil engineering.},

	abstract = {An accurate concrete carbonation predictive model is needed to ensure effective structural health monitoring of concrete, as a result of nonlinear behaviour of concrete carbonation and uncertainties of environmental factors affecting the progress of carbonation. In reality, the performance of a developed predictive model lies on its ability to accurately generalise (simulate) the input distribution within a given new dataset. The previous machine learning models in the studies for concrete carbonation depth rely on the performance of the validation subset used for updating network weights during training and offer no generalisation performance of the model. This study developed a recurrent neural networks (RNN) model to predict the carbonation of fly ash blended concrete. Eighteen input datasets that focused on the chemical parameters of cement and fly ash were used in addition to established environmental factors. A total of 534 sets of experimental data were extracted from 13 published works of the literature. A leave-one-out cross-validation (training and generalisation subsets) was used. The developed RNN model was compared with the artificial neural networks (ANNs), support vector machine (SVM), radial basis function neural networks (RBFNNs), multi-linear regression (MLR) and bagged and boosted decision trees models that have been previously used to model carbonation depth in concrete. The results shows that the proposed RNN has a high prediction and generalisation capability in the evaluation of carbonation depth, and the highest correlation coefficient of 0.94 than the comparing models. Further, the generalisation subsets show that the results of natural exposed conditions are more reliable than the accelerated test cases.},

	abstract = {When simulating the hygrothermal behaviour of a building component, there are many inherently uncertain parameters. A probabilistic evaluation takes these uncertainties into account, allowing a more dependable assessment of the hygrothermal behaviour. However, this often necessitates many Monte Carlo simulations, which easily become computationally inhibitive. To overcome this time-expense problem, the hygrothermal model can be replaced by a metamodel, a much simpler mathematical model which aims at mimicking the original model with a strongly reduced calculation time. In this paper, a metamodel is developed to directly predict hygrothermal time series (e.g. temperature, relative humidity, moisture content), rather than single-valued derived performance indicators (e.g. maximum mould index), as these hygrothermal time series yield more information, and also allow the user to post-process the output as desired. So far, no metamodelling strategies able to tackle time series are available in the field of building physics. Because the hygrothermal response of a building component is highly non-linear and transient, this paper focuses on neural networks for time series, as they have proven successful in many other fields. The performance and training time of three popular types of networks (multilayer perceptron, recurrent neural network, convolutional neural network) is evaluated based on an application example of a massive masonry wall. The results indicate that only the recurrent and convolutional networks are able to capture the complex patterns of the hygrothermal response. Additionally, the convolutional network performed significantly better and was 10 times faster to train for the current application example, compared to the recurrent network.},

However, due to external factors or internal compositions, concrete can be damaged and hence affects the quality of the constructions. The type of damage that appeared on concrete is often the first a clue as to how it occurred. Therefore proper diagnosing of the problem can help engineers determine how quickly and how best to fix it. The application of information technology, especially artificial intelligence, to automatically classify the damage types can help tremendously in this aspect. There have been some studies in using computer vision to examine the surfaces of concrete for damages. This study attempts a more challenging task of classifying the five common types of concrete damage. A new dataset is built and the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architecture is used for classification. The results obtained have an accuracy of 95 and 93\% on the training set and the test set respectively.},

	abstract = {With recent advances in non-contact sensing technology such as cameras, unmanned aerial and ground vehicles, the structural health monitoring (SHM) community has witnessed a prominent growth in deep learning-based condition assessment techniques of structural systems. These deep learning methods rely primarily on convolutional neural networks (CNNs). The CNN networks are trained using a large number of datasets for various types of damage and anomaly detection and post-disaster reconnaissance. The trained networks are then utilized to analyze newer data to detect the type and severity of the damage, enhancing the capabilities of non-contact sensors in developing autonomous SHM systems. In recent years, a broad range of CNN architectures has been developed by researchers to accommodate the extent of lighting and weather conditions, the quality of images, the amount of background and foreground noise, and multiclass damage in the structures. This paper presents a detailed literature review of existing CNN-based techniques in the context of infrastructure monitoring and maintenance. The review is categorized into multiple classes depending on the specific application and development of CNNs applied to data obtained from a wide range of structures. The challenges and limitations of the existing literature are discussed in detail at the end, followed by a brief conclusion on potential future research directions of CNN in structural condition assessment.},

	abstract = {The appearance of cracks is considered an initial sign of the deterioration of structures such as concrete and brick walls. Crack detection plays an important role in ensuring the safety and durability of structures. Conventionally, a maintenance engineer performs crack detection manually, which is laborious and time-consuming. Therefore, a systematic crack detection method is required. Among the existing crack detection methods, convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are more effective; however, CNNs often fail in the case of brick walls. There are several types of bricks, and some may appear to have cracks owing to their structure. Additionally, the joining points of bricks may appear as cracks; therefore, CNN fails. It is theorized that CNN performance can be improved if sub-datasets are generated based on the image attributes, and a proper sub-dataset is selected by matching the test image with the sub-datasets. In this study, sub-dataset generation and matching methods are proposed to improve the performance of crack detection in brick walls using CNN. CNN training is conducted with each sub-dataset generated by the proposed sub-dataset generation method, while crack detection is performed using a proper trained CNN that is selected using the proposed matching method. For numerical experiments, training datasets are first prepared by manual image cropping and rotation, after which the performance of crack detection is evaluated by cross-validation. Numerical experiments show that the proposed method improves crack detection in brick walls. This study will help to ensure the safety of structures as well as the safety of human life.},

	abstract = {Bio-based building materials offer a wide range of outlooks, from traditional rustic to modern design products. Recent development in the science of materials significantly improves their functional performance. However, when considering the use of bio-materials in outdoor environments, materials will deteriorate due to processes like weathering, oxidation, biodegradation, wear, and decay. Consequentially, biomaterials may lose visual appeal, leading to a perceived need for replacement even if the material is far from reaching functional failure. Visual assessment is the most direct method for evaluation of the aesthetic appearance of materials. However, it possesses a high degree of subjectivity when performed by an untrained person. On the contrary, measurement of surface properties with dedicated sensors provides objective values that might be related to the current state of the material in use. Recent developments in field of optics and electronics opens a new possibility to perform measurements in-situ. Colour-, gloss-, or spectro-photo-meters allow non-destructive measurements without particular sample preparation. Since all of the above techniques provide complementary information, the multi-sensor approach is more frequently suggested for applied research. The material state can be assessed regularly during service life. In this case, such measurement turns into monitoring. The paper illustrates examples of assessment and monitoring of biomaterials’ degradation due to weathering. Direct implementation of various sensors is demonstrated. A proposal for the approach of combining data provided by various sensing techniques with data mining is also presented.},

	abstract = {A dual attention deep learning network is developed to classify three types of steel defects, locate their positions, and depict their shapes on the steel surface in an automatic and accurate manner. The novel pixel-level detection algorithm called DAN-DeepLabv3+ integrates a dual attention module into the DeepLabv3+ framework in pursue of more precise segmentation results. For one thing, the dual parallel attention module helps to explicitly model rich contextual dependencies over local feature representations in the spatial and channel dimensions. For another, the popular DeepLabv3+ in an encoder-decoder architecture is useful in capturing multi-scale contextual information and sharp object boundaries. The DAN-DeepLabv3+ is applied to an available dataset containing 6666 images, where three types of steel defects are taken by high-frequency cameras and have been annotated manually. Experimental results show that, compared with other deep learning models, DAN-DeepLabv3+ based on the Xception backbone exhibits the best segmentation performance under the mean intersection over union (IoU) of 89.95\% and the frequency-weighted IoU of 97.34\%. Besides, the F1-score for the three kinds of defects can reach 86.90\%, 99.20\%, and 92.81\%. From the comparative study, it has been found that the adoption of the dual attention module and DeepLabv3+ contributes to boosting the segmentation performance. The significance of the proposed hybrid model lies in the enhancement in accurately detecting single or multiple steel defects, which has proven to outperform other classical methods.},

	abstract = {Remaining fatigue life estimations are crucial for guaranteeing the operation reliability and structural integrity of engineering components. In this respect, physical process-based damage theories and data-driven machine learning (ML) techniques are two useful tools for damage accumulation analyses. However, conventional damage theories are generally limited to specific materials and loading conditions due to over-restrictive assumptions and laborious calibration procedures; on the other hand, ML techniques are easy to be afflicted by the inadequacy of training data in practice. To overcome these limitations, a damage theory-informed machine learning (DT-iML) model is proposed in this work, which enables the integrated utilization of domain knowledge and raw data information. In the model, a damage theory, i.e., the Ye-Wang theory, is introduced as the baseline for optimizing the data-driven processes of model training and prediction. Moreover, the subtractive clustering is further integrated to stabilize the model performance through constructing a global-representative training dataset. Extensive experimental results of nine metallic materials under two-step loading are collected from the literature for model evaluation and comparison. The results demonstrated that the DT-iML model allows for lower data requirement and higher performance stability than purely data-driven ML model, and meanwhile show better estimation accuracy and robustness than conventional damage theory.},

There have been several review articles discussing ML applications in SHM which mostly provide broad discussions across different civil engineering structures. In this article, different ML applications in the bridge SHM study are summarised and discussed. Detailed critiques of each types of ML applications are provided. Finally, recommendations are made for the future study of ML applications in bridge SHM to fill the current research gaps.},

	abstract = {Structural health monitoring is an essential process for ensuring the safety and serviceability of civil structures. When a structure suffers from damage, it is necessary to implement maintenance programs for returning the structural performance and integrity to its initial normal condition. An important challenge is that the structure of interest may be damaged even after a sophisticated maintenance program. This conveys the great necessity of performing the second level of structural condition assessment and damage detection of maintained structures. To achieve this aim, this article proposes a novel methodology using the concept of supervised learning. The main objective of the proposed methodology is to train various supervised learning classifiers using a training dataset that consists of features regarding both the undamaged and damaged states of the structure before the maintenance program in the first level. Once the classifiers have been trained, one attempts to predict the class labels of test samples associated with the current state of the structure after the maintenance program during the second level. According to the predefined class labels of the training and test samples in the first stage, it is feasible to recognize the current state of the maintained structure in the second level and detect potential damage. The major contribution of this article is to introduce the concept of supervised learning for damage detection in an innovative manner. A numerical concrete beam and an experimental laboratory frame are used to demonstrate the effectiveness and applicability of the proposed methodology. Results show that this methodology is a practical and reliable tool for structural condition assessment and damage detection of maintained structures.},

	abstract = {Structural steel connections are highly susceptible to damage due to long-term effect such as missing or loosening of bolts along with corrosion, fatigue, accidental loads etc. throughout their service life. The existing local connection damage identification methods require expensive instrumentation and the sensors at a specific location. That is why, artificial intelligence (AI) has become very popular and has come up with better alternatives, efficiency which can overcome the shortcomings of traditional vibration-based connection damage identification techniques. As per the current literature, most of the AI-based techniques that use experimentally generated damage data suffer the paucity of appropriate and quality dataset corresponding to different damage conditions. Hence the authors have proposed a model-based scheme for evaluating the health condition of steel structural connection in such cases, which uses a combination of Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and Continuous Wavelet Transform (CWT) of the response signal. The method requires only global vibration signals from impulse excitation on the structure and subsequently the updated finite element (FE) model of steel structure considering connection flexibility can be utilized for multiple functionalities. For experimental validation of the proposed methodology, a two-story structural steel frame has been considered. The performance of the proposed methodology is further verified and validated through the identification of beam-column connection damage additionally introduced in the test frame.},

	abstract = {The Impact-Echo (IE) test is an effective method for determining the presence, depth, and area of cracks in concrete as well as the dimensions of the sound concrete without defects. In addition, shallow delamination can be measured by confirming a flexural mode in the low-frequency region. Owing to the advancement of non-contact sensors and automated measurement equipment, the IE test can be measured at multiple points in a short period. To analyze and distinguish a large volume of data, applying supervised learning (SL) associated with various contemporary algorithms is necessary. However, SL has limitations due to the difficulty in accurate labeling for increased volumes of test data, and reflection of new specimen characteristics, and it is necessary to apply semi-supervised learning (SSL) to overcome them. This study analyzes the accuracy and evaluates the applicability of a model trained with SSL rather than SL using the data from the air-coupled IE test based on dynamic preconditions. For the detection of delamination defects, the dynamic behavior-based flexural mode was identified, and 21 features were extracted in the time and frequency domains. Three principal components (PCs) such as the real moment, real RMS, and imaginary moment were derived through principal component analysis (PCA). PCs were identical in slab, pavement, and deck. In the case of SSL considering a dynamic behavior, the accuracy increased by 7–8\% compared with SL, and it could categorize good, fair, and poor status to a higher level for actual structures. The applicability of SSL to the IE test was confirmed, and because the crack progress varies under field conditions, other parameters must be considered in the future to reflect this.},

Minimal differences were found among clones in the mass loss of the heartwood samples, while significant inter-clonal differences emerged in the mass loss of sapwood samples. Intra-clonal variation was detected for sapwood samples and only in one of the four tested clones.

	abstract = {The use of recycled concrete aggregates (RCA) as a replacement in new concrete has gained popularity worldwide as a method of reducing natural aggregate consumption. Many engineers, owners, and agencies are reticent to use RCA due to a lack of understanding on how the material will impact overall concrete properties. This lack of acceptance has been hindered by the difficulty of doing large-scale studies because of the time and cost of casting different concrete mixtures. Many individual studies have been completed but little work has been done to analyze that work to make broad conclusions on RCA concrete mechanical properties. This paper presents the development and analysis of a database of mechanical properties of concrete containing coarse RCA generated from 115 peer-reviewed journal articles. A sensitivity study of RCA systems was conducted through a full-factorial analysis to explore how the mixture design proportions influence the RCA concrete hardened properties. On average, the compressive strengths of concrete systems with 20\% or less RCA replacement were 2\% lower than that of the natural aggregate systems. Increased levels of RCA replacements decreased the average concrete compressive strengths with the highest average strength loss, in which a 10\% reduction compared to natural aggregate systems is observed at 100\% RCA replacement level. Results indicate that, in general, adequate concrete strengths for a variety of applications can be achieved at all replacement ratios of coarse RCA. Impacts of mixture design properties on particular mechanical properties are presented along with bivariate contour plots that can be used by concrete mixture designers to better estimate RCA concrete properties.

	abstract = {The biological durability of wood is an important property for outdoor applications of wood-based products. In temperate climate zones, the most critical biological hazard is wood-destroying fungi, and the European standard EN 350 in combination with EN 113-2 provide guidance on sampling, testing, and classifying wood durability against brown and white rot fungi. However, in their latest revised versions, both standards recommend the use of probability density functions for fitting mass loss data (ML). Subsequently, the durability of wood and its variability should be further characterised. The aim of this study was to statistically analyse the ML data from laboratory agar plate tests with different European-grown wood species and to examine the effect of different statistical treatments on the standardised classification scheme of wood durability. It was concluded that more precise guidance is needed on the sampling procedure since significant differences in durability exist between stem zones. The assignment of dispersion indicators requires a revision to ensure clear, unmistakable, and reproducible durability classification of wood. Deficits in the description of the proposed statistical treatments in both standards became evident. It can be questioned whether the application of probability density functions provides additional information about the variability of wood durability.},

Exposure of these objects to aggressive environmental conditions, together with me­ chanical actions, can lead to deterioration and ultimate destruction. In the present study, a 3D hygro-mechanical meso-scale model for wood is formulated and implemented into the 3D finite element code MASA. The proposed coupled model, consisting of mechanical and non-mechanical part (transport of moisture), is validated against experimental tests available in the literature, confirming its suitability for realistic modeling of wood.},

	abstract = {The quality control of wood products is often only checked at the end of the production process so that countermeasures can only be taken with a time delay in the event of fluctuations in product quality. This often leads to unnecessary and cost-intensive rejects. Furthermore, since quality control often requires additional procedural steps to be performed by a skilled worker, testing is time-consuming and costly. While traditional machine learning (ML) methods based on supervised learning have been used in the field with some success, the limited availability of labeled data is the major hurdle for further improving model performance. In the present study, the potential of enhancing the performance of the ML methods random forest (RF) and support vector machines (SVM) for quality classification by using semi-supervised learning (SSL) was investigated. Labeled and unlabeled data were provided by Swiss Wood Solutions AG, which produces densified wood for high-value wood products such as musical instruments. The developed approach includes labeling of the unlabeled data using SSL, training and 10k cross-validation of the ML algorithms RF and SVM, and determining the generalization ability using the hold-out test set. Based on the evaluation indices such as accuracy, F1-score, recall, false-positive-rate and confusion matrices, it was shown that SSL could enhance the prediction performance of the quality classification of ML models compared to the conventional supervised learning method. Despite having a small dataset, the work paves the way for future applications of SSL for wood quality assessment.},

In this article, we propose a novel improved Isolation Forest (IIF) algorithm based on the assumption that anomaly pixels are more susceptible to isolation than background pixels. The proposed IIF is a modiﬁed version of the Isolation Forest (iForest) algorithm, which addresses the poor performance of iForest in detecting local anomalies and anomaly detection in high-dimensional data. Furthermore, we propose a spectral–spatial anomaly detector based on IIF (SSIIFD) to make full use of global and local information, as well as spectral and spatial information. To be speciﬁc, ﬁrst, we apply the Gabor ﬁlter to extract spatial features, which are then employed as input to the relative mass isolation forest (ReMass-iForest) detector to obtain the spatial anomaly score. Next, original images are divided into several homogeneous regions via the entropy rate segmentation (ERS) algorithm, and the preprocessed images are then employed as input to the proposed IIF detector to obtain the spectral anomaly score. Finally, we fuse the spatial and spectral anomaly scores by combining them linearly to predict anomaly pixels. The experimental results on four real hyperspectral datasets demonstrate that the proposed detector outperforms other state-of-the-art methods.},

	abstract = {This study presented an unsupervised anomaly detection-based framework for distributed damage detection in concrete using ultrasonic response signals. A deep fully connected auto-encoder was employed to reconstruct the ultrasonic response signals. This model was trained on the intact specimen’s responses. The auto-encoder demonstrated a relatively high prediction error encountering the damaged specimen’s responses. Two time-domain features (mean squared error and reconstructed-to-original signal ratio) and one frequency-domain feature (fundamental amplitude ratio) were defined to measure the reconstruction error of the auto-encoder (the damage-sensitive features). Finally, the Isolation Forest algorithm was implemented for anomaly (damage) detection. The beauty of this framework is that it requires a few numbers of data only from the intact specimen for training the auto-encoder and collecting the binary decision trees of the Isolation Forest. The framework was successfully implemented for damage detection in five geopolymer concrete specimens with different mix proportions. Using all three introduced damage-sensitive features, the framework demonstrated an average prediction accuracy of 95.0\% and 93.0\% for damaged and intact stages, respectively.},

	abstract = {Structural steel connections are highly susceptible to damage due to long-term effect such as missing or loosening of bolts along with corrosion, fatigue, accidental loads etc. throughout their service life. The existing local connection damage identification methods require expensive instrumentation and the sensors at a specific location. That is why, artificial intelligence (AI) has become very popular and has come up with better alternatives, efficiency which can overcome the shortcomings of traditional vibration-based connection damage identification techniques. As per the current literature, most of the AI-based techniques that use experimentally generated damage data suffer the paucity of appropriate and quality dataset corresponding to different damage conditions. Hence the authors have proposed a model-based scheme for evaluating the health condition of steel structural connection in such cases, which uses a combination of Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and Continuous Wavelet Transform (CWT) of the response signal. The method requires only global vibration signals from impulse excitation on the structure and subsequently the updated finite element (FE) model of steel structure considering connection flexibility can be utilized for multiple functionalities. For experimental validation of the proposed methodology, a two-story structural steel frame has been considered. The performance of the proposed methodology is further verified and validated through the identification of beam-column connection damage additionally introduced in the test frame.},

	abstract = {Pavement crack detected plays an important role in pavement maintenance. Image recognition is a traditional way for pavement crack detected. Recently, deep learning is a stateof-the-art method for target detection. CNN (convolutional neural network), a significant method in deep learning, is widely used in image target detection and brings about breakthroughs. However, CNN has not been applied to pavement crack detection. In this paper, we apply CNN to detect pavement crack and PCA (Principal Component Analysis) to classify the detected pavement cracks. Firstly, two databases are obtained by using two different scales of grid (32×32, 64×64) to segment pavement images. Each database has 30000 images for training set. We obtain two kinds of trained CNN. Each CNN is trained by one training set, which is part of each scale databases. We use trained CNN to detect the existence of pavement crack in corresponding scale grids. We confirm the scale of segment grid by comparing the results of pavement crack detected. Secondly, we only keep the grids containing crack and achieve the skeleton of crack in a pavement image. Lastly, we use PCA to analyse the skeleton of crack. The classification of crack can be obtained. The F-measure for crack detection is 94.7\%. Meanwhile, the proposed method achieves 97.2\%, 97.6\% and 90.1\% correct rate of classification for longitudinal crack, transverse crack and alligator crack, respectively.

Reinforced concrete buildings are modelled as single-degree-of-freedom systems and various time-history nonlinear analyses are performed to create a dataset of damage indices. Subsequently, two decision trees are trained using the qualitative interpretations of those indices. The ﬁrst decision tree determines whether damage occurs in an RC building. Consequently, the second decision tree predicts the severity of damage as repairable, beyond repair, or collapse.},

	abstract = {This paper develops and employs an ensemble machine learning (ML) model for prediction of surface chloride concentration (Cs) of concrete, which is an essential parameter for durability design and service life prediction of concrete structures in marine environment. For this purpose, a database containing 642 data-records of ﬁeld exposure data of Cs (along with the associated mixture proportion parameters, environmental conditions and exposure time) is established based on extensive literature surveying, which covers splash, tidal, and submerged zones in various areas in the world. The database is used to train ﬁve standalone ML models, that is, linear regression (LR), Gaussian process regression (GPR), support vector machine (SVM), multilayer perceptron artiﬁcial neural network (MLP-ANN) and random forests (RF) models, as well as an ensemble weighted votingbased ML model, and subsequently used to compare their prediction performances. It is shown that, by metaheuristically combining predictions of RF, MLP-ANN, and SVM, the ensemble ML model produces higher accuracy of prediction compared to all standalone ML models tested in this study. The prediction performances of eight conventional quantitative models for Cs prediction are also analyzed based on the testing dataset selected for ML. The results show that adoption of more diverse datasets and consideration of more factors in conventional models can improve their prediction performance. The ensemble ML model established on a large database, can easily consider the twelve inﬂuencing factors (which is diﬃcult for conventional models) in the database, and has superior prediction performance, yet better time-eﬃciency, compared to conventional models.},

Traditional methods for this type of work commonly comprise of engaging building surveyors to undertake a condition assessment which involves a lengthy site inspection to produce a systematic recording of the physical condition of the building elements, including cost estimates of immediate and projected long-term costs of renewal, repair and maintenance of the building. Current asset condition assessment procedures are extensively time consuming, laborious, and expensive and pose health and safety threats to surveyors, particularly at height and roof levels which are difficult to access. This paper aims at evaluating the application of convolutional neural networks (CNN) towards an automated detection and localisation of key building defects, e.g., mould, deterioration, and stain, from images. The proposed model is based on pre-trained CNN classifier of VGG-16 (later compaired with ResNet-50, and Inception models), with class activation mapping (CAM) for object localisation. The challenges and limitations of the model in real-life applications have been identified. The proposed model has proven to be robust and able to accurately detect and localise building defects. The approach is being developed with the potential to scale-up and further advance to support automated detection of defects and deterioration of buildings in real-time using mobile devices and drones.},

	abstract = {The longevity of timber structures in exposed outdoor environments is often perceived to be unreliable as compared with that of concrete and steel structures. This situation is exacerbated to some extent by the fact that the European commission for standardization (CEN) currently provides no quantitative method for service life assessment of timber structures. To counteract this, the present thesis deals with methods for the quantitative service life assessment of timber in outdoor above-ground construction.{\textless}br/{\textgreater}{\textless}br/{\textgreater}Wood moisture content and temperature, i.e. the material climate involved, are two fundamental indicators of decay activity of wooden members. Performance based service life assessment of wood is largely comprised of two parts: (1) establishing the relationship between the environmental conditions and the material climate, and (2) establishing the relationship between the material climate and the rate of deterioration. The former depends on factors such as weather parameters, material properties and the design of details.{\textless}br/{\textgreater}{\textless}br/{\textgreater}Two experimental trials were conducted in order to acquire data concerning the relationship between the environmental conditions and the moisture content of the wood. The aim of the first experiment was to study typical details utilized for timber bridges with respect to their variation in moisture content. The type of detailing employed was shown to have a great effect on the moisture conditions, with the exposed contact areas and the end-grain being subject to increased levels of moisture content. The second experiment focused on the effects of long-term superficial damage on the moisture conditions of wood. It was shown that superficial damage caused by photo degradation and checking lead to increased moisture absorption and consequently to a longer duration of surface wetness. {\textless}br/{\textgreater}{\textless}br/{\textgreater}The relationship between environmental conditions and material climate was estimated through numerical modelling, which involves the explicit modelling of moisture transport within the wooden member and the exchange of moisture at the surfaces that are exposed. The model was applied to one-dimensional transverse moisture transport as well as to multi-dimensional transport in the case of simple details, such as side-grain to side-grain contact areas. The numerical model was then coupled with decay prediction models so as to map the relative decay hazard in European climates.},

In impact-echo test, surface motion generated by short-duration mechanical impact is investigated for structural condition assessment. This paper endeavours to formulate impact echo analysis by using novel statistical techniques, i.e. Grassmann manifold learning. Comparing to conventional impact-echo test, the proposed method presents several favourable properties: 1. Conventional impact-echo method mostly relies on frequency peak in echo spectrum, the proposed method characterizes rich temporal-spectral patterns in addition to the spectral peak. 2. Proposed method is performed over local area on concrete surface with integration of several consecutive echo responses, and thus produces more stable condition evaluation result comparing to point-wise impact-echo approach. 3. To cope with extracted echo feature, effective similarity metric on Grassmann manifold is employed, which favourably facilities condition-based assessment. To demonstrate the proposed method, we prepared concrete specimen with 2cm, 4cm and 6cm depth void inside and echo signal is captured through air-coupled sensor. Experimental result demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed method, including accurate condition-based classification performance and high processing efficiency},

To address this issue, we develop a dynamic risk assessment (DRA) method that allows online estimation of risk indexes using data collected during operation. Two types of data are considered: statistical failure data, which refer to the counts of accidents or near misses from similar systems and condition-monitoring data, which come from online monitoring the degradation of the target system of interest. For this, a hierarchical Bayesian model is developed to compute the reliability of the safety barriers and a Bayesian updating algorithm, which integrates particle filtering (PF) with Markov Chain Monte Carlo, is developed to update the reliability evaluations based on both the statistical and condition-monitoring data. The updated safety barriers reliabilities, are, then, used in an event tree (ET) for consequence analysis and the risk indexes are updated accordingly. A case study on a high-flow safety system is conducted to demonstrate the developed methods. A comparison to the DRA method which only uses statistical failure data shows that by introducing condition-monitoring data on the system degradation process, it is possible to capture the system-specific characteristics, and, therefore, provide a more complete and accurate description of the risk of the target system.},

	abstract = {Background: Defect detection and segmentation on product surfaces in industry has become one of the most important steps in quality control. There are many sophisticated hardware and software tools used in the industry for this purpose. The need for the real-time classification and detection of defects in industrial quality control has become a crucial requirement. Most algorithms and deep neural network architectures require expensive hardware to perform inference in real-time. This necessitates the design of architectures that are light-weight and suitable for deployment in industrial environments. Methods: In this study, we introduce a novel method for detecting wood planks on a fast-moving conveyor and using a convolutional neural network (CNN) to segment surface defects in real-time. A backbone network is trained with a large-scale image dataset. A dataset of 5000 images is created with proper annotation of wood planks and defects. In addition, a data augmentation technique is employed to enhance the accuracy of the model. Furthermore, we examine both statistical and deep learning-based approaches to identify and separate defects using the latest methods. Results: Our plank detection method achieved an impressive mean average precision of 97\% and 96\% of global pixel accuracy for defect segmentation. This remarkable performance is made possible by the real-time processing capabilities of our system, which can run at 30 frames per second (FPS) without sacrificing accuracy. Conclusions: The results of our study demonstrate the potential of our method not only in industrial wood processing applications but also in other industries where materials undergo similar processes of defect detection and segmentation. By utilizing our method, these industries can expect to see improved efficiency, accuracy, and overall productivity.},

	abstract = {The principal bioactive phenolic component of ginger (Zingiber officinale Rosc.) rhizome is 6-gingerol, which is known to have several sensory and therapeutic properties. Due to its antimicrobial, anti-biofilm, anti-cancer, and anti-inflammatory properties, a sizable global market for ginger has been generated. The variation in yield of 6-gingerol is observed with changes in environmental, agronomic, and genetic conditions. The current study aims to examine how environmental and climatic factors affect 6-gingerol content using an artificial neural network (ANN) model and predict a new location to produce 6-gingerol. ANN-based models; MLP (multilayer perceptron) and RBF (radial basis function) with the desirable learning algorithms, transfer functions, number of neurons, and hidden layers were designed. The dataset of 60 unique Zingiber officinale rhizomes obtained from ten agro-climatic zones of Odisha was included in this study. The content of 6-gingerol was ascertained using a high-performance thin-layer chromatography (HPTLC) technique. The experimental dataset was randomly divided into 70 \% for training, 15 \% for testing, and 15 \% for validation to carry out the optimization. In 60 accessions from various locations of Odisha, the concentration of 6-gingerol in ginger rhizomes ranged from 0.203 \% to 0.813 \% on a wet weight basis. It was revealed that the ANN model with the MLP algorithm was superior to the RBF algorithm. The findings showed that an ANN-MLP architecture with a single hidden layer of 11 neurons and a 16–11–1 topology could accurately predict the content of 6-gingerol, with an R2 (coefficient of determination) of 0.99. Altitude, pH, maximum temperature, and phosphorus were identified as the factors that influenced the model's prediction accuracy, which was 95 \%. The content of 6-gingerol was enhanced from 0.363 \% to 0.408 \% by regulating the present model's sensitive parameters. The current study concluded that the developed ANN model efficiently predicts the best region for optimum 6-gingerol yield.},

Both network architectures are compared to assess their suitability in the process of a hot flow curve description under a wide range of thermomechanical conditions. The performed survey is also aimed on the eventual utilization of corresponding modifications of both studied networks, namely on a Cascade-Forward Multi-Layer Perceptron and Generalized Regression network. The main results have shown that the Feed-Forward Multi-Layer Perceptron architecture represents a good choice if very high accuracy is a crucial goal. However, in the case of this architecture, finding the proper parameters can be time-consuming and the hardware burdensome. On the contrary, for the flow curve description the almost unused Radial Basis network offers a very easy training procedure and significantly shorter computing time under acceptable accuracy. The results of the submitted research should then serve as a background for the selection and following application of a suitable network architecture in the process of solving future flow curve description tasks.},

	abstract = {Q-learning, originally an incremental algorithm for estimating an optimal decision strategy in an infinite-horizon decision problem, now refers to a general class of reinforcement learning methods widely used in statistics and artificial intelligence. In the context of personalized medicine, finite-horizon Q-learning is the workhorse for estimating optimal treatment strategies, known as treatment regimes. Infinite-horizon Q-learning is also increasingly relevant in the growing field of mobile health. In computer science, Q-learning methods have achieved remarkable performance in domains such as game-playing and robotics. In this article, we (a) review the history of Q-learning in computer science and statistics, (b) formalize finite-horizon Q-learning within the potential outcomes framework and discuss the inferential difficulties for which it is infamous, and (c) review variants of infinite-horizon Q-learning and the exploration-exploitation problem, which arises in decision problems with a long time horizon. We close by discussing issues arising with the use of Q-learning in practice, including arguments for combining Q-learning with direct-search methods; sample size considerations for sequential, multiple assignment randomized trials; and possibilities for combining Q-learning with model-based methods.},

Although wildly successful under laboratory conditions, serious gaps between theory and practice as well as a lack of formal guarantees prevent its use in the real world. Adopting a dynamical systems perspective, we provide a theoretical analysis of a popular version of Deep Q-Learning under realistic and verifiable assumptions. More specifically, we prove an important result on the convergence of the algorithm, characterizing the asymptotic behavior of the learning process. Our result sheds light on hitherto unexplained properties of the algorithm and helps understand empirical observations, such as performance inconsistencies even after training. Unlike previous theories, our analysis accommodates state Markov processes with multiple stationary distributions. In spite of the focus on Deep Q-Learning, we believe that our theory may be applied to understand other deep learning algorithms},

One challenging problem when applying DQN or other reinforcement learning algorithms to real world problem is data collection.

In this paper, we propose a framework which uses the Max-Mean loss in Deep Q-Network (M\${\textasciicircum}2\$DQN). Instead of sampling one batch of experiences in the training step, we sample several batches from the experience replay and update the parameters such that the maximum TD-error of these batches is minimized. The proposed method can be combined with most of existing techniques of DQN algorithm by replacing the loss function. We verify the effectiveness of this framework with one of the most widely used techniques, Double DQN (DDQN), in several gym games.

	abstract = {The deep Q-network (DQN) is one of the most successful reinforcement learning algorithms, but it has some drawbacks such as slow convergence and instability. In contrast, the traditional reinforcement learning algorithms with linear function approximation usually have faster convergence and better stability, although they easily suffer from the curse of dimensionality. In recent years, many improvements to DQN have been made, but they seldom make use of the advantage of traditional algorithms to improve DQN. In this paper, we propose a novel Q-learning algorithm with linear function approximation, called the minibatch recursive least squares Q-learning (MRLS-Q). Different from the traditional Q-learning algorithm with linear function approximation, the learning mechanism and model structure of MRLS-Q are more similar to those of DQNs with only one input layer and one linear output layer. It uses the experience replay and the minibatch training mode and uses the agent’s states rather than the agent’s state-action pairs as the inputs. As a result, it can be used alone for low-dimensional problems and can be seamlessly integrated into DQN as the last layer for high-dimensional problems as well. In addition, MRLS-Q uses our proposed average RLS optimization technique, so that it can achieve better convergence performance whether it is used alone or integrated with DQN. At the end of this paper, we demonstrate the effectiveness of MRLS-Q on the CartPole problem and four Atari games and investigate the influences of its hyperparameters experimentally.},

In total 117 comparisons were drawn between data from both types of durability testing from which the acceleration and deceleration factors were derived. It was found that for usual WPC formulations weatherometer trials according to EN ISO 4892 represent 7.35 times longer periods under natural conditions. Further, the quality of data was an enabler for the development of algorithms which comprehensively detected that lifespan for 30\%-fiber loaded compounds is 1.7-times longer compared to those with 45\% fiber share.

Current computerized hammer sounding systems commonly employ lab-scale data to validate the models. In practice, however, the response signal patterns can be far more complicated due to varying geometric shapes and materials of structures. To deal with a large variety of unseen data, we propose a sequential treatment for response characterization. More specifically, the proposed system can adaptively update itself to approach human performance in hammering sounding data interpretation. To this end, a two-stage framework has been introduced, including feature extraction and the model updating scheme. Various state-of-the-art online learning algorithms have been reviewed and evaluated for the task. To conduct experimental validation, we collected 10,940 response instances from multiple inspection sites; each sample was annotated by human experts with healthy/defective condition labels. The results demonstrated that the proposed scheme achieved favorable assessment accuracy with high efficiency and low computation load.},

The proposed non-destructive testing method combines a new multi-sensor testing system with advanced statistical signal processing techniques and state-of-the-art machine learning algorithms for the condition assessment of timber utility poles. Currently used pole inspection techniques have critical limitations including the inability to assess the underground section. GW methods, on the other hand, are techniques potentially capable of evaluating non-accessible areas and of detecting internal damage. However, due to the lack of solid understanding on the GW propagation in timber poles, most methods fail to fully interpret wave patterns from field measurements. The proposed method utilises an innovative multi-sensor testing system that captures wave signals along a sensor array and it applies machine learning algorithms to evaluate the soundness of a pole. To validate the new method, it was tested on eight in-situ timber poles. After the testing, the poles were dismembered to determine their actual health states. Various state-of-the-art machine learning algorithms with advanced data pre-processing were applied to classify the poles based on the wave measurements. It was found that using a support vector machine classifier, with the GW signals transformed into autoregressive coefficients, achieved a very promising maximum classification accuracy of 95.7±3.1\% using 10-fold cross validation on multiple training and testing instances. Using leave-one-out cross validation, a classification accuracy of 93.3±6.0\% for bending wave and 85.7±10.8\% for longitudinal wave excitation was achieved.},

Generally, concrete cracks are visually monitored by inspectors who record crack information such as the existence, location, and width. Manual visual inspection is often considered ineffective in terms of cost, safety, assessment accuracy, and reliability. Digital image processing has been introduced to more accurately obtain crack information from images. A critical challenge is to automatically identify cracks from an image containing actual cracks and crack-like noise patterns (e.g. dark shadows, stains, lumps, and holes), which are often seen in concrete structures. This article presents a methodology for identifying concrete cracks using machine learning. The method helps in determining the existence and location of cracks from surface images. The proposed approach is particularly designed for classifying cracks and noncrack noise patterns that are otherwise difficult to distinguish using existing image processing algorithms. In the training stage of the proposed approach, image binarization is used to extract crack candidate regions; subsequently, classification models are constructed based on speeded-up robust features and convolutional neural network. The obtained crack identification methods are quantitatively and qualitatively compared using new concrete surface images containing cracks and noncracks.},

A condition assessment framework that utilizes AI and sensor data is an important part of such an autonomous control system. A nuclear power plant has various structures, systems, and components (SSCs) such as piping-equipment that carries coolant to the reactor. Piping systems can degrade over time because of flow-accelerated corrosion and erosion. Any cracks and leakages can cause loss of coolant accident (LOCA). The current industry standards for conducting maintenance of vital SSCs can be time and cost-intensive. AI can play a greater role in the condition assessment and can be extended to recognize concrete degradation (chloride-induced damage and alkali–silica reaction) before cracks develop. This paper reviews developments in condition assessment and AI applications of structural and mechanical systems. The applicability of existing techniques to nuclear systems is somewhat limited because its response requires characterization of high and low-frequency vibration modes, whereas previous studies focus on systems where a single vibration mode can define the degraded state. Data assimilation and storage is another challenging aspect of autonomous control. Advances in AI and data mining world can help to address these challenges.},

In this paper, we attempt to enhance the IE technique and enable it for full condition assessment of concrete elements by introducing advanced machine learning techniques for performing comprehensive analysis and pattern recognition of IE signals. Specifically, we use wavelet decomposition for extracting signatures or features out of the raw IE signals and apply extreme learning machine, one of the recently developed machine learning techniques, as classification models for full condition assessment. To validate the capabilities of the proposed method, we build a number of specimens with various types, sizes, and locations of defects and perform IE testing on these specimens in a lab environment. Based on analysis of the collected IE signals using the proposed machine learning based IE method, we demonstrate that the proposed method is effective in performing full condition assessment of concrete elements or structures.},

	abstract = {Methods employed for surveying buildings for condition have traditionally been reliant upon visual assessment and manual recording. Survey of traditional masonry also ostensibly conforms to this approach but, due to the sheer volume of masonry units composing walls, it is often prohibitively time consuming, exceptionally complex and ultimately costly. Notable features of such survey work for ashlar stone types require each stone to be labelled and overlaid with information relative to condition. Further hindering these already costly operations, it has been shown that the accuracy of reporting, including labelling the manifestation of defects and defect diagnosis, is subjective, depending upon the expertise and experience of those evaluating the fabric. Moving beyond these preliminary survey and reporting stages, this situation gives rise to variable repair and maintenance strategies that can have significant cost implications and can debase fundamental conservation activities. The development of digital technologies, such as terrestrial laser scanning, and advancements in novel computer vision statistical techniques can help produce accurate representation of buildings that can be subsequently rapidly processed, achieving many tangible survey functions with greater inherent objectivity. In this paper, an innovative strategy for automatic detection and classification of defects in digitised ashlar masonry walling is presented. The classification method is based on the use of supervised machine learning algorithms, assisted by surveyors' strategies and expertise to identify defective individual masonry units, through to broader global patterns for groups of stones. The proposed approach has been tested on the main façade of the Chapel Royal in Stirling Castle (Scotland), demonstrating its potential for ashlar masonry forms of wall construction. It is important to recognise that the findings are not limited to this culturally significant building and will be of high value to almost innumerable ashlar-built structures worldwide. The research ultimately attempts to reduce the degree of subjectivity in classifying defects, on a scale and rapidity hitherto beyond traditional project cost constraints. Importantly, it is recognised that through automation more effective utilisation of resources that would have been traditionally spent on survey can be redeployed to support fabric intervention or routine maintenance operations.},

Due to the fact that destructive methods are not suitable for historical buildings of great architectural significance, a non-destructive method based on electrical tomography has been adopted. A hybrid tomograph with special sensors was developed for the measurements. This device enables the acquisition of data, which are then reconstructed by appropriately developed methods enabling spatial analysis of wet buildings. Special electrodes that ensure good contact with the surface of porous building materials such as bricks and cement were introduced. During the research, a group of algorithms enabling supervised machine learning was analyzed. They have been used in the process of converting input electrical values into conductance depicted by the output image pixels. The conductance values of individual pixels of the output vector made it possible to obtain images of the interior of building walls as both flat intersections (2D) and spatial (3D) images. The presented group of algorithms has a high application value. The main advantages of the new methods are: high accuracy of imaging, low costs, high processing speed, ease of application to walls of various thickness and irregular surface. By comparing the results of tomographic reconstructions, the most efficient algorithms were identified.},

	abstract = {The load resisting capacity of structural members will decrease when they are subjected to long-term sustained load. Such phenomenon is widely known as the duration of load effect, which is mainly caused by the damage accumulation in the material. The deterioration mechanism of the material is a typical stochastic process which is influenced by a large variety of parameters involving complex physical and chemical process. Although classical models have been proposed to evaluate the duration of load effect, it is nearly impossible to quantify the influence of various parameters and to achieve an accurate estimation. To optimize the combination of complexity and goodness-of-fit, a neural network model is proposed in this paper to evaluate the duration of load effect in wood structural members. Taking individual uncertainties into consideration, the proposed model treats the damage in wood as a Markov process and can estimate the residual strength distribution of the investigated wood structural members under long-term sustained load. The coefficient of determination reaches above 95\% under sustained loading scenario, and it shows good adaptability across different wood properties. Moreover, the model can be adapted to continuously varied loading scenarios with a 98\% coefficient of determination. This research aims to provide a useful and straightforward tool for accurately predicting the duration of load effect in wood structural members, and the proposed algorithm can be easily modified to deal with similar engineering problems for other construction materials.},

	abstract = {The prediction of long-term performance is a crucial step in the effective structural design of adhesively bonded connections. A lack of knowledge on the durability of the FRP-to-concrete bonded connections compromises structural safety and requires employing higher safety factors in design. This study examines the capability of machine learning techniques in studying the long-term performance of FRP-to-concrete bonded connections under moisture conditions. A comprehensive database of 429 durability test results is built and used to develop various machine learning models. A Bayesian optimisation method is employed during the model development to tune the machine learning hyperparameters. Based on the detailed evaluation of prediction results, artificial neural networks (ANN) and ensemble models are proposed to study the bond strength and the failure mode of the connections. The ANN model is used to evaluate the impact of various moisture conditioning regimes on bond strength. The contribution of environmental factors in identifying the failure mode is studied by the ensemble method. Moreover, a practical equation is proposed by the M5P model tree method to predict the bond strength. The prediction results in this study indicate the capability of machine learning in predicting the durability of FRP-bonded concrete connections under moisture conditions.},

Its essence is to use well-known concepts in statistics for boundary definition of different pattern classes, such as those for damaged and undamaged structures. In this paper, several statistical pattern recognition algorithms using autoregressive models, including statistical control charts and hypothesis testing, are reviewed as potentially competitive damage detection techniques. To enhance the performance of statistical methods, new feature extraction techniques using model spectra and residual autocorrelation, together with resampling-based threshold construction methods, are proposed. Subsequently, simulated acceleration data from a multi degree-of-freedom system is generated to test and compare the efficiency of the existing and proposed algorithms. Data from laboratory experiments conducted on a truss and a large-scale bridge slab model are then used to further validate the damage detection methods and demonstrate the superior performance of proposed algorithms.},

This highlights the benefit of NDT data fusion to evaluate accurately concrete properties. In this paper, NDT measurements from GPR, electrical resistivity and ultrasonic pulse velocity were combined to predict more accurately concrete properties such as strength and water content. Two techniques of data fusion were used namely Response Surface Method (RSM) and artificial neural networks (ANNs). The results obtained show the effectiveness of the statistical modeling to predict the properties of concretes by fusion of NDT measurements. In the context of this study, the performances of the two techniques of fusion appear relevant in terms of water content and concrete strength prediction. ANN models exhibit better predictive ability than RSM ones.},

	abstract = {In recent years, the number of reinforced concrete structures with anomalies associated with reinforcement corrosion problems has significantly increased. One of the causes is concrete carbonation which occurs when carbon dioxide (CO2) penetrates the concrete’s porous system to create an environment with lower pH around the reinforcement in which corrosion can proceed. Several analytical models describe the relationship between carbonation depth and concrete age, of which the most frequently used results from Fick’s first law: x=Kt, where K is the carbonation coefficient. This coefficient depends on environmental conditions such as CO2 concentration and humidity and concrete characteristics like w/c ratio, type of cement, and so it varies significantly from one structure to another. A statistical study is presented in this paper to enable a better evaluation of K in open air concrete structures. The study is based on the results of over 100 measurements taken on existing structures up to 99years old. The results were statistically analysed to obtain correlations between K and factors such as structure age, the effect of painting, concrete compressive strength and exposure conditions. This analysis allowed recommendations for the covering of reinforcing bars to be made at design level.},

Compressive strength and electrical resistivity tests were used to evaluate the mortars’ performance. A multi-regression (MR) model was also utilised to study the effects of curing time and content of OPC, GGBS and HCFA on the mortars’ strength and to identify the relationship between measured and predicted compressive strengths. The results indicated that the newly developed binder was composed of 35 wt\% OPC, 35 wt\% GGBS and 30 wt\% HCFA that showed a compressive strength and surface electrical resistivity of 30.8 MPa and 103.5 kΩ.cm after 56 days of curing, respectively. Significant changes in the microstructure of the developed binder paste over curing time were evidenced by SEM imaging. The statistical analysis indicated that the influence of the parameters examined on the development of the mortars’ compressive strength could be modelled with a coefficient of determination, R2 of 0.893, and that the relative importance of these parameters followed the order curing time (t)  {\textgreater} HCFA\% {\textgreater} OPC\% {\textgreater} GGBS\%.

For the structural materials alloyed steel 15Cr2MoVA, steel C45 and aluminium alloy D16T1, the statistical distribution of proportional limit, yield strength, ultimate tensile strength, reduction in area, cyclic stress was estimated, as well as the following statistical parameters: mathematical mean, average square deviation, dispersion, asymmetry, variation coefficient, and excess. Purpose: to determine whether the limits of the sensitivity of the statistical distribution of the mechanical characteristics have been computed using the maximum likelihood method. Value: there is a certain upward and downward flattening of the probability curves in the statistical distribution curves of the fatigue test results. This implies that the chosen law of the distribution of random variables has an effect on the appearance of errors. These errors are unacceptable given the importance of accurately determining the reliability and durability of transport means, shipbuilding, machinery, and other important structures. Our results could potentially explain why sensitive limits cannot be applied to the statistical distribution of the mechanical characteristics of structural materials.},

The panels were tested as-they-were – no initial sterilization or particular test microorganisms were used. The tested panels showed notable growth of different types of moulds. The main mould occurred from the Genus Aspergillus what is considered as xerophilic. Under the optical microscope the network of fungal mycelium was detected also on panels what did not show visible growth. Environmentally friendly wood-based panels are very susceptible to the surface mould development whenever the favourable moisture conditions appear. The RH for the development of xerophilic moulds is relatively low –– about 75\% RH, what is rather common condition in the construction site. Surface mould, even it is not visible or actively growing, is potentially harmful to habitants. The results of this work were highly valuable to both scientists and structural engineers.},

The application of statistical and probability methods provides for the possibility of improving the characteristics related to the structural life and the justification for the respective values of cyclic loads in the design stage. Most studies investigating statistical descriptions of crack initiation or complete failure do not analyse the distribution of the characteristics, correlation relationships, and statistical parameters of low-cycle fatigue. Low-cycle failure may be quasistatic or (due to the fatigue) transient. Materials with contrasting cyclic properties were selected for the investigation: cyclically softening alloyed steel 15Cr2MoVA; cyclically stable structural steel C45; cyclically hardening aluminium alloy D16T1. All samples were produced in a single batch of each respective material to reduce the distribution of data. The lowest values of the variation coefficient of one of the key statistical indicators were obtained using the log-normal distribution, which is superior to the normal or Weibull distribution. Statistical analysis of the durability parameters showed that the distribution was smaller than the parameters of the distribution of the deformation diagram. The results obtained in the study enable the verification of durability and life of the structural elements of in-service facilities subjected to elastoplastic loading by assessing the distribution of characteristics of crack initiation and failure and low-cycle strain parameters as well as the permissible distribution limits.},

Frequently, several actions develop simultaneously, making it difficult to reproduce in situ conditions in laboratory. Furthermore, testing to assess durability depends largely on the nature of the material itself or on the way it has been assembled with other materials. The ageing techniques to assess long-term durability performance of construction materials are based on accelerated durability tests, which include, for example, thermal stress, freeze–thaw cycles, air pressure, salt crystallization, chemical weathering, and ultraviolet radiation. These tests allow the assessment of the materials’ structural integrity, as well as their aesthetics. In this chapter, the main trends on durability tests on construction materials, such as clay-based, cementitious and polymeric composites, natural stone, metals, wood, and bituminous binders and mixtures, will be presented and discussed.},

	abstract = {As an important part of prognostics and health management, remaining useful life (RUL) prediction can provide users and managers with system life information and improve the reliability of maintenance systems. Data-driven methods are powerful tools for RUL prediction because of their great modeling abilities. However, most current data-driven studies require large amounts of labeled training data and assume that the training data and test data follow similar distributions. In fact, the collected data are often variable due to different equipment operating conditions, fault modes, and noise distributions. As a result, the assumption that the training data and the test data obey the same distribution may not be valid. In response to the above problems, this paper proposes a data-driven framework with domain adaptability using a bidirectional gated recurrent unit (BGRU). The framework uses a domain-adversarial neural network (DANN) to implement transfer learning (TL) from the source domain to the target domain, which contains only sensor information. To verify the effectiveness of the proposed method, we analyze the IEEE PHM 2012 Challenge datasets and use them for verification. The experimental results show that the generalization ability of the model is effectively improved through the domain adaptation approach.},

	abstract = {During concrete production, simple and quick testing methods are desired for assessing concrete properties. Non-destructive testing methods, NDT, are particularly valuable in the Quality Assurance and Quality Control (QA/QC) process since do not interfere with production of concrete and reduce testing time and cost. Concrete hardening, and thus strength gain, is one of the most important parameters in concrete production since it can immediately identify potential issues in concrete proportioning, curing conditions, and use of questionable ingredients that affect strength and stiffness. NDTs can provide early warnings in meeting strength requirements at early ages as well as long term strength. NDTs are also valuable in providing strength gain predictions so that follow-up construction can continue once the minimum critical strength is achieved. This research was developed based on the recommendations of a recent national study undertaken by the authors for Federal Highway Administration in developing an NDT based QA process for highway materials. Thus, it was the objective of this research to identify and assess alternative NDT methods that can be used in monitoring and/or estimating strength gain in concrete, and thus for potential adoption an NDT based QA plan. These NDTs should be fast, accurate, reliable and simple to run. The NDT methods explored in this study included: infrared thermography, ultrasonic pulse velocity, and fundamental resonance frequency. The results from such testing methods were coupled with maturity modeling for monitoring and predicting concrete strength at early ages. The results provided good relationships with the maturity index. Even though the relationships of these NDT outputs with the maturity index were based on limited set of experimental data, it is expected that their accuracy will improve with complementary testing on additional concrete mixtures. The methodology of this study is applicable elsewhere where similar materials and construction methods are used.},

	abstract = {Nowadays, fastening systems represent a very important part of the construction industry due to their versatility and use in reconstruction. Therefore, it is essential to study and understand phenomena and effects influencing the lifetime of a fastening system. However, the mechanisms are complex and not yet fully understood. As a result, numerical models, which are reliable and are able to capture all involved effects, are needed. The basis of these models is a wide range of high quality data, for model development, calibration, and validation purposes. Within the 7-year Christian Doppler Laboratory (CDL) of Life Cycle Robustness, an extensive concrete data base, consisting of short-term mechanical properties of concrete, time-dependent measurements as well as tests on full fastening systems, was generated. The material tests reach from compression, indirect tensile, and fracture tests to long-term creep and shrinkage tests. Shear and pull-out tests were carried out on bonded and mechanical anchors. In order to characterize the long-term performance, sustained load and time to failure tests were conducted at a system level. In total, 12 concrete mixes were tested. This contribution will give an overview of the performed tests and will highlight the importance of sound experimental data.},

	abstract = {Synthetic fiber reinforced polymer (FRP) composites are widely used in construction, mechanical engineering, aerospace and automobiles, and other applications where high ratios of mechanical properties relative to mass are required. During the manufacturing, storage, and service, various environmental conditions may affect the long-term performance of FRP composites. A degradation of performance of FRP composites is caused by chemical, physical, and mechanical properties such as temperature, moisture, alkalinity and acidity, ultraviolet radiation, as well as their combinations with mechanical loading in time. In this chapter, the durability of synthetic FRP composites under those above-mentioned environmental conditions is reviewed. The life-prediction approaches for FRP composites are reviewed focusing on the most used concepts such as time-temperature superposition principle (TTSP), and its wide applications through Arrhenius Plots in combination with accelerated aging test data. Accelerated aging test methods aim to assess the “long-term” durability of FRP composites within a short period of time. This is motivated by two aspects: (i) the investigation on realistic long-term performance of FRPs under in-service environmental conditions takes unaffordable time and (ii) the results are nearly impossible to be extended in many cases having different weathering conditions, loading conditions and material characteristics. At the end, the challenges for life predictions of FRP composites are highlighted.},

The strength and durability properties of concrete containing RCA were evaluated by a comprehensive experimental investigation involving nine control mixes. The variables considered in the experimental study are water cement ratio, cement content in concrete and percentage replacement of coarse aggregate. The strength properties such as compressive strength, modulus of elasticity, splitting tensile strength and flexural strength are studied. Durability properties such as water absorption, sorptivity, acid attack resistance and chloride permeability are also determined. The test results showed that up to 25\% of natural crushed stone aggregates in concrete may be replaced with RCA, without significantly affecting the strength of concrete and that the partial replacement of natural aggregates with RCA can be recommended in areas of moderate exposure conditions. Mathematical models developed in the study can be used for the a priori prediction of the strength parameters of RCA concrete. A mix design methodology using the developed models is proposed to aid practicing engineers to determine the mix proportions of RCA concrete.},

This paper outlines and draws conclusions about different aspects of the material efficiency of buildings and assesses the significance of different building materials on the material efficiency. The research uses an extensive literature study and a case-study in order to assess: should the depletion of materials be ignored in the environmental or sustainability assessment of buildings, are the related effects on land use, energy use and/or harmful emissions significant, should related indicators (such as GHGs) be used to indicate the material efficiency of buildings, and what is the significance of scarce materials, compared to the use of other building materials. This research suggests that the material efficiency should focus on the significant global impacts of material efficiency; not on the individual factors of it. At present global warming and greenhouse gas emissions are among the biggest global problems on which material efficiency has a direct impact on. Therefore, this paper suggests that greenhouse gas emissions could be used as an indicator for material efficiency in building.},

It attempts to provide a greater understanding of the influence of CO2 curing on the chemical and physical properties of various types of alkali-activated binders used in pastes, mortars, and concrete. Several aspects related to changes in chemistry and mineralogy have been carefully identified and discussed, including depth of CO2 interaction, sequestration, reactions with calcium-based phases (e.g., calcium hydroxide and calcium silicate hydrates and calcium aluminosilicate hydrates), as well as other aspects related to the chemical composition of alkali-activated materials. Emphasis has also been given to physical alterations such as volumetric changes, density, porosity, and other microstructural properties caused by induced carbonation. Moreover, this paper reviews the influence of the accelerated carbonation curing method on the strength development of alkali-activated materials, which has been awarded little attention considering its potential. This curing technique was found to contribute to the strength development mainly through decalcification of the Ca phases existing in the alkali-activated precursor, leading to the formation of CaCO3, which leads to microstructural densification. Interestingly, this curing method seems to have much to offer in terms of mechanical performance, making it an attractive curing solution that can compensate for the loss in performance caused by less efficient alkali-activated binders replacing Portland cement. Optimising the application of such CO2-based curing methods for each of the potential alkali-activated binders is recommended for future studies for maximum microstructural improvement, and thus mechanical enhancement, to make some of the “low-performing binders” adequate Portland cement substitutes.},

Recent studies have, however, highlighted the problems related to uncertainties in the LCA results. The aim of this study is to assess the sensitivity of construction materials to the different modelling choices in order to highlight their consequences at the building scale. In particular, we focused on the different modelling options in terms of database choices, system boundary definitions and replacement scenarios of building materials during the whole service life of the buildings. The assessment of uncertainties was conducted at two levels: the material or element level and the building level. The results clearly show the importance of these modelling choices. Variations on the overall assessment of buildings are significant, but the details at the material scale show that not all materials are similarly sensitive to these choices. We identified those materials that have a large contribution to the environmental impact of the buildings and which are also sensitive to different modelling choices. This can help for a better understanding of these modelling choices and can be used in upcoming regulations or public policies.},

	abstract = {The construction sector plays a significant role in contributing to greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, necessitating effective and practical solutions. This study addresses the underutilization of Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) in the construction sector and demonstrates its benefits as a decision-making tool for mitigating embodied carbon. The research focuses on a G+2 building in Dubai, UAE, conducting LCA during the construction phases to assess embodied carbon levels. Results indicate that the careful selection of construction materials and involvement of LCA at the early stages of construction resulted in a 26 \% reduction in the building's embodied carbon. The study recognizes the limitations of LCA but emphasizes its value and recommends future research to enhance its coverage of sustainability aspects. The findings highlight the construction sector's potential to overcome anthropogenic challenges through green solutions. Policymakers' support is crucial for implementing strategies that reduce the construction industry's carbon footprint and embrace a circular economy. The study contributes to the literature by bridging the gap in understanding the application of LCA in construction decision-making. It emphasizes the importance of transitioning to sustainable practices and circularity in the construction sector. By using LCA as a tool, construction professionals can make informed choices to reduce embodied carbon. This study underscores the urgency for adopting greener practices in the construction sector, leading to a more sustainable and low-carbon future.},

	abstract = {This study investigated the factors affecting the carbonation of alkali-activated slag concrete (AASC). Concrete durability plays an important role in the longevity of concrete structures, but aggressive chemical agents can leave major undesirable impacts on the durability of concrete. One of such chemical agents is CO2 gas, whose penetration into concrete leads to a carbonation process which facilitates the electrochemical corrosion of steel reinforcements. One of the weaknesses of alkali-activated slag concrete in comparison with Portland cement concrete is its lower resistance against carbonation. Thus, in this paper, we studied the effect of such parameters as alkaline solution to slag ratio, partial replacement of slag with microsilica, compressive strength, and curing method on the carbonation of alkali-activated slag concrete. The samples were subjected to accelerated carbonation by being placed in a CO2 gas chamber for two cycles of 14 and 28 days, and then the resulting depth of carbonation was measured and analyzed. A sample of ordinary Portland cement concrete was used as the control sample. The SEM images taken from the samples were studied to determine the changes in the structure of the cement paste. The results showed that the replacement of 15\% of slag with microsilica has a significant positive effect on the carbonation depth of alkali-activated slag concrete. Compared with the exponential relationships offered for ordinary concrete in the literature, the relationship between compressive strength and carbonation depth of AAS concrete was linear. The results showed that carbonation depth decreases with increase in compressive strength and decrease in AAS concrete permeability.},

	abstract = {In order to reduce the negative environmental impact of municipal domestic waste incineration bottom ash (MSWIBA), it is converted into lightweight aggregates by cold bonding technology. To enhance the utilization of waste materials, minimize cement consumption, and fabricate artificial aggregates with superior comprehensive performance, we designed and synthesized alkali-activated aggregates (AAAs) in this study. This study used MSWIBA and ground granulated blast furnace slag (GGBFS) as precursors for alkali-activated aggregates (AAAs), activated by a mixture of sodium hydroxide solutions and sodium silicate. The physical and mechanical prop­ erties of AAAs, including water absorption, apparent density, crushing strength and carbon-resistance, were investigated at different NaOH concentrations. In addition, the microstructure, mineral composition, aggrega­ tion, porosity and heavy metal leaching behavior of AAAs were analyzed by SEM, XRD, FTIR, TGA, MIP and ICP techniques. All AAAs exhibited a consistent particle size distribution, characterized by apparent densities spanning the range of 1633–1940 kg/m3. The leaching levels of heavy metals align with the standards estab­ lished by Chinese regulations. Among the different activator concentrations tested, aggregate (M4) displayed superior single-particle crushing strength (3.90 MPa) and better carbonization resistance. It also used a lower concentration of NaOH, which enabled more cost-effective and eco-friendly production. Overall, the findings suggest that MSWIBA can be a viable precursor for producing sustainable lightweight concrete, with 4 M NaOH being the optimal activator concentration for achieving the best performance.},

This study emphasizes the significance of incorporating the minimization of embodied emissions into all parts of the building, with a focus on the measurement of embodied carbon, concepts of its management and strategies proposed and enacted for mitigation. As estimate is an important part of any debate, the measurement approach covers the uncertainty analysis from diverse points of view through a novel approach; management covers the early design tools, and the significance of the lifecycle stages; mitigation covers the reduction strategies of embodied carbon, although reduction in embodied carbon is a subjective topic and depends on region. The analysis covers the ideal approaches for mitigation irrespective of the region.},

The study outlines the steps involved in developing a BIM-LCA API, including code development and validation with commercial software. The research identifies challenges in creating a uniform database platform for BIM-LCA, and the need for region-specific databases to provide automated material classification for measuring potential environmental consequences. The study also emphasizes the importance of establishing market-level sustainability standards through the development of relevant tools, training techniques, and procedures, and the need for national rating systems to align with these standards to achieve European climate adaptation and circularity goals.

	abstract = {Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) is considered an innovative tool to analyze environmental impacts to make decisions aimed at improving the environmental performance of building materials and construction processes throughout different life cycle stages, including design, construction, use, operation, and end-of-life (EOL). Therefore, during the last two decades, interest in applying this tool in the construction field has increased, and the number of articles and studies has risen exponentially. However, there is a lack of consolidated studies that provide insights into the implementation of LCA on construction and demolition waste (C\&DW). To fill this research gap, this study presents a literature review analysis to consolidate the most relevant topics and issues in the research field of C\&DW materials and how LCA has been implemented during the last two decades. A systematic literature search was performed following the PRISMA method: analysis of selected works is based on bibliometric and content-based approaches. As a result, the study characterized 150 selected works in terms of the evolution of articles per year, geographical distribution, most relevant research centers, and featured sources. In addition, this study highlights research gaps in terms of methodological and design tools to improve LCA analysis, indicators, and connection to new trending concepts, such as circular economy and industry 4.0.},
